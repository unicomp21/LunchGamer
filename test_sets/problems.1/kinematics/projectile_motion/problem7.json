  "question": "A ball is kicked horizontally off a cliff with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. The cliff is 80 m above the ground. Approximately how long does it take for the ball to reach the ground? (Assume g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.8 s",
    "B": "4.0 s",
    "C": "5.7 s",
    "D": "8.0 s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "Since the ball is kicked horizontally, its horizontal velocity remains constant at 10 m/s. The vertical motion is independent of the horizontal motion and can be treated as free fall with an initial vertical velocity of 0 m/s. Using the equation y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at^2, we can solve for the time t when the ball reaches the ground (y = 0):\n\n0 = 80 + 0 + (1/2)(-10)t^2\n-80 = -5t^2\n16 = t^2\nt = 4 s\n\nTherefore, the ball takes approximately 4 seconds to reach the ground."
