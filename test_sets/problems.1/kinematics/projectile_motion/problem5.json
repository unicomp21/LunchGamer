  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally off a 50 m tall building with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, how far from the base of the building will the ball land? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "50 m",
    "B": "60 m",
    "C": "70 m",
    "D": "80 m"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The horizontal and vertical components of motion are independent. The time for the ball to fall is found using the vertical motion equation: y = y0 + v0y*t + 0.5*a*t^2, where y = -50 m, y0 = 0, v0y = 0, and a = -10 m/s^2. Solving, t = sqrt(2*50/10) = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16 s. \n\nThe horizontal distance traveled is dx = v0x*t = 20*3.16 ≈ 63.2 m. However, since this is a multiple choice question, we round 63.2 to the nearest choice, which is 70 m (choice C)."
