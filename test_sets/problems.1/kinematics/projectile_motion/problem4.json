  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a 40 m tall building with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, how long does it take for the ball to reach the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 s",
    "B": "2.5 s",
    "C": "2.8 s",
    "D": "4 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Since the ball is thrown horizontally, the horizontal and vertical motions can be analyzed separately. The time taken for the ball to reach the ground depends only on the vertical motion, which is under the influence of gravity.\n\nUsing the equation: y = y0 + v0y * t + (1/2) * ay * t^2, where y0 = 40 m (initial height), v0y = 0 (initial vertical velocity), and ay = -10 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity).\n\nSubstituting y = 0 (ground level) and solving for t:\n0 = 40 + 0 * t + (1/2) * (-10) * t^2\n-5 * t^2 = -40\nt^2 = 8\nt = √8 ≈ 2.8 s\n\nTherefore, the ball takes approximately 2.8 seconds to reach the ground."
