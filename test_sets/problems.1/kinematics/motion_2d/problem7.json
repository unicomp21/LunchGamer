  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a 40-meter tall building with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, approximately how far from the base of the building will the ball land? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "20 meters",
    "B": "40 meters",
    "C": "57 meters",
    "D": "80 meters"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The ball's motion can be separated into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal velocity remains constant at 20 m/s. The time of flight can be found using the vertical motion equation: y = y0 + v0y*t + 0.5*a*t^2, where y0 = 40 m, v0y = 0, and a = -10 m/s^2. Setting y = 0 (ground level), we get: 0 = 40 + 0.5*(-10)*t^2. Solving for t gives t ≈ 2.83 s. The horizontal distance traveled is then: x = v0x*t = 20*2.83 ≈ 57 m. Therefore, the ball will land approximately 57 meters from the base of the building."
