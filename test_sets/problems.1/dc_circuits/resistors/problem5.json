  "question": "In a parallel circuit with three resistors, R1 = 6 Ω, R2 = 3 Ω, and R3 = 2 Ω. If a 12 V battery is connected to the circuit, what is the total current in the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "4 A",
    "D": "6 A"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "In a parallel circuit, the total resistance (Req) is found using the formula 1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\n1/Req = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2\n1/Req = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1\nReq = 1 Ω\n\nThe total current (I) in the circuit can be found using Ohm's Law: I = V / R, where V is the voltage (12 V) and R is the total resistance (1 Ω).\n\nI = 12 V / 1 Ω = 12 A\n\nTherefore, the total current in the parallel circuit is 12 A."
