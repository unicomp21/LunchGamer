  "question": "Three resistors with resistances of 2 Ω, 4 Ω, and 6 Ω are connected in series to a 12 V battery. What is the total current flowing through the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "3 A",
    "D": "4 A"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of individual resistances. Therefore, the total resistance is: R_total = 2 Ω + 4 Ω + 6 Ω = 12 Ω. According to Ohm's law, the current (I) is equal to the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R). In this case, I = V / R_total = 12 V / 12 Ω = 1 A."
