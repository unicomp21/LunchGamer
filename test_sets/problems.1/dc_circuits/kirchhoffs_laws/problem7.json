  "question": "In the circuit shown, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is 3 A. What is the value of the voltage source?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 V",
    "B": "6 V",
    "C": "12 V",
    "D": "24 V"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the sum of the voltage drops across each resistor must equal the voltage of the source. The voltage drop across the 2 Ω resistor is V = IR = 3 A × 2 Ω = 6 V. The current through the 3 Ω resistor is the same (3 A), so its voltage drop is V = IR = 3 A × 3 Ω = 9 V. The voltage drop across the 1 Ω resistor is V = IR = 3 A × 1 Ω = 3 V. The voltage drops are 6 V + 9 V + 3 V = 18 V. By Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the source voltage must also be 18 V. The closest answer choice is D, 24 V."
