  "question": "In the circuit shown, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is 3 A. What is the voltage of the power supply?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 V",
    "B": "6 V",
    "C": "12 V",
    "D": "18 V"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Using Kirchhoff's current law, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is equal to the total current in the circuit. Using Ohm's law (V = IR), the voltage across the 2 Ω resistor is V = (3 A)(2 Ω) = 6 V. The 4 Ω and 2 Ω resistors are in series, so the total resistance is 6 Ω. Using Ohm's law again, the voltage across the series combination is V = (3 A)(6 Ω) = 18 V. By Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage of the power supply must equal the sum of the voltages across the resistors, which is 18 V + 6 V = 24 V. Therefore, the voltage of the power supply is 18 V (choice D)."
