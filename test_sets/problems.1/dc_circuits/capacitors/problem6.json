  "question": "Two capacitors with capacitances C1 = 2 μF and C2 = 3 μF are connected in series to a 12 V battery. What is the equivalent capacitance of the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.2 μF",
    "B": "5.0 μF",
    "C": "6.0 μF",
    "D": "0.83 μF"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance (1/Ceq) is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances:\n\n1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2\n1/Ceq = 1/(2 μF) + 1/(3 μF)\n1/Ceq = 3/(6 μF) + 2/(6 μF)\n1/Ceq = 5/(6 μF)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\nCeq = 6/5 μF = 1.2 μF\n\nTherefore, the equivalent capacitance of the circuit is 1.2 μF."
