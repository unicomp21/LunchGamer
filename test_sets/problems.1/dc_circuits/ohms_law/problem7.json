  "question": "A resistor with a resistance of 10 Ω is connected to a 9 V battery. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.09 A",
    "B": "0.9 A",
    "C": "9 A",
    "D": "90 A"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's law, the current I through a resistor is equal to the voltage V across the resistor divided by its resistance R, i.e., I = V / R. In this case, the voltage is 9 V and the resistance is 10 Ω. Substituting these values into the equation, we get I = 9 V / 10 Ω = 0.9 A. Therefore, the current flowing through the resistor is 0.9 A."
