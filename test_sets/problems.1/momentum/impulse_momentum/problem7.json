  "question": "A tennis ball with a mass of 60 g is hit by a racquet, applying an average force of 120 N over a time of 0.01 s. What is the change in momentum of the tennis ball?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.12 kg⋅m/s",
    "B": "0.72 kg⋅m/s",
    "C": "1.2 kg⋅m/s",
    "D": "7.2 kg⋅m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The change in momentum can be calculated using the impulse-momentum theorem: Δp = F⋅Δt, where Δp is the change in momentum, F is the average force, and Δt is the time interval. Given: m = 60 g = 0.06 kg, F = 120 N, Δt = 0.01 s. Substituting the values: Δp = 120 N ⋅ 0.01 s = 1.2 N⋅s = 1.2 kg⋅m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1.2 kg⋅m/s."
