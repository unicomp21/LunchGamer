  "question": "A 2 kg ball is thrown straight up with an initial speed of 10 m/s. If the ball is in contact with the thrower's hand for 0.1 seconds during the throw, what is the magnitude of the average force exerted on the ball by the thrower?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "20 N",
    "B": "50 N",
    "C": "100 N",
    "D": "200 N"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse applied to it. Mathematically, Δp = FΔt, where Δp is the change in momentum, F is the average force, and Δt is the time interval over which the force is applied. The change in momentum can be calculated as Δp = mv_f - mv_i, where m is the mass of the object, v_f is the final velocity, and v_i is the initial velocity. In this case, v_i = 0 (the ball starts from rest), so Δp = mv_f = (2 kg)(10 m/s) = 20 kg·m/s. Using the impulse-momentum theorem, we can solve for the average force: F = Δp / Δt = (20 kg·m/s) / (0.1 s) = 200 N."
