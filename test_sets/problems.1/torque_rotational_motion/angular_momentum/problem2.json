  "question": "A solid disk of mass 2 kg and radius 0.5 m rotates about an axis through its center. If the disk has an angular velocity of 4 rad/s, what is its angular momentum?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "B": "1 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "C": "2 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "D": "4 kg⋅m^2/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by L = Iω, where I is the object's moment of inertia and ω is its angular velocity. For a solid disk rotating about its center, the moment of inertia is I = (1/2)mr^2, where m is the mass and r is the radius. Plugging in the given values, we have:\n\nI = (1/2)(2 kg)(0.5 m)^2 = 0.25 kg⋅m^2\n\nNow we can calculate the angular momentum:\n\nL = Iω = (0.25 kg⋅m^2)(4 rad/s) = 1 kg⋅m^2/s\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 1 kg⋅m^2/s."
