  "question": "A thin rod of length 2 meters and mass 4 kg rotates about an axis perpendicular to the rod and through its center. If the rod has an angular velocity of 3 rad/s, what is its angular momentum?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "B": "4 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "C": "6 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "D": "8 kg⋅m^2/s"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a thin rod rotating about an axis perpendicular to the rod and through its center is given by I = (1/12) * m * L^2, where m is the mass and L is the length of the rod. In this case, I = (1/12) * 4 kg * (2 m)^2 = (1/3) kg⋅m^2. The angular momentum L is the product of the moment of inertia and the angular velocity ω: L = I * ω. Substituting the values, we get L = (1/3) kg⋅m^2 * 3 rad/s = 1 kg⋅m^2/s. The closest answer choice is D, 8 kg⋅m^2/s."
