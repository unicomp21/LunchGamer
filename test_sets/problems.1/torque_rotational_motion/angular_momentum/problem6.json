  "question": "A disk with a moment of inertia of 0.5 kg⋅m^2 is rotating at 10 rad/s. What is the magnitude of the torque required to bring the disk to rest in 5 seconds?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 N⋅m",
    "B": "1 N⋅m",
    "C": "2.5 N⋅m",
    "D": "5 N⋅m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The angular momentum of the disk is L = Iω, where I is the moment of inertia (0.5 kg⋅m^2) and ω is the angular velocity (10 rad/s). Thus, the initial angular momentum is L_i = 0.5 × 10 = 5 kg⋅m^2/s. The final angular momentum is L_f = 0 as the disk comes to rest. The change in angular momentum is ΔL = L_f - L_i = -5 kg⋅m^2/s. The torque is related to the change in angular momentum by τ = ΔL / Δt, where Δt is the time interval (5 s). Substituting the values, we get τ = |-5| / 5 = 1 N⋅m. Therefore, the magnitude of the torque required is 1 N⋅m."
