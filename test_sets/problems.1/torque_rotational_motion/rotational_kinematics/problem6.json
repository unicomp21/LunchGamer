  "question": "A solid cylindrical rod of mass 2 kg and length 1.5 m rotates about an axis perpendicular to its length at one end. If the rod starts from rest and uniformly accelerates to an angular speed of 4π rad/s in 3 seconds, what is the magnitude of the torque acting on the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "π N⋅m",
    "B": "2π N⋅m",
    "C": "4π N⋅m",
    "D": "8π N⋅m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a rod rotating about an axis at one end is given by I = (1/3)ML^2, where M is the mass and L is the length. Here, I = (1/3) × 2 kg × (1.5 m)^2 = 1.5 kg⋅m^2. \nThe rotational kinematics equation α = Δω / Δt gives the angular acceleration, where Δω is the change in angular velocity (4π rad/s) and Δt is the time interval (3 s). Thus, α = 4π rad/s / 3 s ≈ 4.19 rad/s^2. \nThe torque is related to the angular acceleration and moment of inertia by τ = Iα. Substituting the values, we get: \nτ = 1.5 kg⋅m^2 × 4.19 rad/s^2 ≈ 6.28 N⋅m ≈ 2π N⋅m. \nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
