  "question": "A disc of radius 0.5 m rotates about a fixed axis through its center. If the disc starts from rest and uniformly accelerates to an angular velocity of 4π rad/s in 2 seconds, what is the angular acceleration of the disc?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "π rad/s^2",
    "B": "2π rad/s^2",
    "C": "4π rad/s^2",
    "D": "8π rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The angular acceleration can be found using the formula α = Δω / Δt, where Δω is the change in angular velocity (4π rad/s) and Δt is the time interval (2 s). Thus, α = 4π rad/s / 2 s = 2π rad/s^2."
