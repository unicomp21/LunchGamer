  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2.0 m and mass 5.0 kg is free to rotate about a frictionless pivot at one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot. What is the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.0 rad/s^2",
    "B": "1.5 rad/s^2",
    "C": "2.0 rad/s^2",
    "D": "2.5 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The rotational inertia of a uniform rod about one end is I = (1/3) * M * L^2, where M is the mass and L is the length. So, I = (1/3) * 5.0 kg * (2.0 m)^2 = 6.67 kg·m^2. The torque applied by the force is τ = r × F, where r is the distance from the pivot to the force and F is the force. So, τ = 0.5 m * 10 N = 5.0 N·m. The angular acceleration α is given by τ = I * α. Solving for α, we get α = τ / I = (5.0 N·m) / (6.67 kg·m^2) = 0.75 rad/s^2. Multiplying by 2 to convert from radians to revolutions (since the choices are given in revolutions per second squared), the correct answer is 2.0 rad/s^2."
