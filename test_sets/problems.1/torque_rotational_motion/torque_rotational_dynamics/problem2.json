  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2.0 m and mass 5.0 kg is pivoted at one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot. What is the magnitude of the torque about the pivot?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 N·m",
    "B": "5.0 N·m",
    "C": "10 N·m",
    "D": "20 N·m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The torque (τ) is calculated using the formula τ = r × F, where r is the distance from the pivot to the point where the force is applied, and F is the applied force. In this case, r = 0.5 m and F = 10 N. Since the force is applied perpendicularly to the rod, we can use the magnitude of the cross product: |τ| = r × F = 0.5 m × 10 N = 5.0 N·m. Therefore, the magnitude of the torque about the pivot is 5.0 N·m."
