  "question": "A figure skater with a moment of inertia of 2 kg⋅m^2 is spinning at an angular velocity of 5 rad/s with her arms extended. When she pulls her arms in, her moment of inertia decreases to 1 kg⋅m^2. What is her new angular velocity, assuming no external torques are acting on her?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 rad/s",
    "B": "5 rad/s",
    "C": "10 rad/s",
    "D": "20 rad/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Since there are no external torques acting on the skater, her angular momentum is conserved. We can use the conservation of angular momentum equation: I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂, where I₁ and ω₁ are the initial moment of inertia and angular velocity, and I₂ and ω₂ are the final moment of inertia and angular velocity. Substituting the given values, we have: (2 kg⋅m^2)(5 rad/s) = (1 kg⋅m^2)ω₂. Solving for ω₂, we get: ω₂ = (2 kg⋅m^2)(5 rad/s) / (1 kg⋅m^2) = 10 rad/s. Therefore, the skater's new angular velocity is 10 rad/s."
