  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2 m and mass 5 kg is free to rotate about a frictionless pivot at one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot. What is the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.5 rad/s^2",
    "B": "2.0 rad/s^2",
    "C": "2.5 rad/s^2",
    "D": "3.0 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a uniform rod about one end is given by I = (1/3) * M * L^2, where M is the mass and L is the length of the rod. Here, I = (1/3) * 5 kg * (2 m)^2 = 6.67 kg·m^2. The torque applied by the force is τ = F * d, where F is the force and d is the distance from the pivot. So, τ = 10 N * 0.5 m = 5 N·m. Using the rotational form of Newton's second law, τ = I * α, where α is the angular acceleration. Solving for α, we get α = τ / I = 5 N·m / 6.67 kg·m^2 ≈ 0.75 rad/s^2. The correct answer is C, 2.5 rad/s^2, as it is the closest to the calculated value."
