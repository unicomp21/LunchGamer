  "question": "A figure skater with arms extended is spinning at 2 rad/s. When she pulls her arms in, her rotational speed increases to 6 rad/s. What is the ratio of her initial rotational inertia to her final rotational inertia?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1:3",
    "B": "1:9",
    "C": "3:1",
    "D": "9:1"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "By the conservation of angular momentum, L = I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂, where L is the angular momentum, I₁ and I₂ are the initial and final rotational inertia, and ω₁ and ω₂ are the initial and final angular velocities. Rearranging the equation, we get I₁/I₂ = ω₂/ω₁ = 6 rad/s / 2 rad/s = 3. Thus, the ratio of the initial rotational inertia to the final rotational inertia is 3:1 = 9:1."
