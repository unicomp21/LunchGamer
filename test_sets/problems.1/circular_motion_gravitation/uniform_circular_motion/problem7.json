  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite? (Take the mass of Earth as 6 × 10^24 kg and the gravitational constant G as 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 × 10^3 N",
    "B": "3.1 × 10^3 N",
    "C": "4.2 × 10^3 N",
    "D": "5.0 × 10^3 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force between the satellite and Earth. Using Newton's law of universal gravitation, F = GMm/r^2, where M is the mass of Earth (6 × 10^24 kg), m is the mass of the satellite (500 kg), r is the orbital radius (8000 km = 8 × 10^6 m), and G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2). Substituting these values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (6 × 10^24 kg) × (500 kg) / (8 × 10^6 m)^2\n  = 3.126 × 10^3 N ≈ 3.1 × 10^3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite is approximately 3.1 × 10^3 N, which corresponds to choice B."
