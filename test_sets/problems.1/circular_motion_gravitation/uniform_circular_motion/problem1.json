  "question": "A 1.2 kg ball is tied to a string and swung in a horizontal circle of radius 0.8 m, making 2 revolutions per second. What is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "15 N",
    "B": "30 N",
    "C": "60 N",
    "D": "120 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. The centripetal force is given by F = mv^2/r, where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius. The velocity can be found using v = 2πrf, where f is the frequency (revolutions per second). Plugging in the values:\n\nv = 2π(2 rev/s)(0.8 m) = 10.05 m/s\n\nThen the tension is:\nF = (1.2 kg)(10.05 m/s)^2 / (0.8 m) = 60.25 N \n\nRounding to two significant figures gives 60 N. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
