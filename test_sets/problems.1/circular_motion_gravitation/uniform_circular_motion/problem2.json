  "question": "A satellite with a mass of 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite? (Take the mass of Earth as 6 × 10^24 kg and the gravitational constant G as 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.08 × 10^3 N",
    "B": "4.17 × 10^3 N",
    "C": "8.33 × 10^3 N",
    "D": "1.67 × 10^4 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by gravity. The magnitude of the gravitational force is given by:\n\nF = G * (M * m) / r^2\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Earth, m is the mass of the satellite, and r is the radius of the orbit.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) * (6 × 10^24 kg * 500 kg) / (8000 km)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) * (3 × 10^27 kg⋅m^2) / (6.4 × 10^13 m^2)\nF ≈ 4.17 × 10^3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite is approximately 4.17 × 10^3 N."
