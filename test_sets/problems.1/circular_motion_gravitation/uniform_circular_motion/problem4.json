  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite? (Assume the mass of Earth is 6.0 × 10^24 kg and the gravitational constant G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.6 × 10^3 N",
    "B": "3.1 × 10^3 N",
    "C": "4.2 × 10^3 N",
    "D": "5.8 × 10^3 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "For uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force. Using Newton's law of universal gravitation, F = GMm/r^2, where M is the mass of Earth (6.0 × 10^24 kg), m is the mass of the satellite (500 kg), r is the radius of the orbit (8000 km or 8 × 10^6 m), and G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2). Plugging in the values, we get: F = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (6.0 × 10^24 kg) × (500 kg) / (8 × 10^6 m)^2 ≈ 3.1 × 10^3 N. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
