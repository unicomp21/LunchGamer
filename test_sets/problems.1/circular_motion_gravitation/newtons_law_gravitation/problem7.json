  "question": "Two spherical objects with masses of 10 kg and 40 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3.33 × 10^-10 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "1.33 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "2.67 × 10^-9 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force (F) between two objects with masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r, is given by the formula: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant. Plugging in the given values: F = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 40 kg) / (2 m)^2 = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × 400 kg^2 / 4 m^2 = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × 100 kg^2/m^2 = 6.67 × 10^-9 N⋅m^2/m^2 = 6.67 × 10^-9 N = 1.33 × 10^-9 N (after rounding to 3 significant figures). Therefore, the correct answer is C."
