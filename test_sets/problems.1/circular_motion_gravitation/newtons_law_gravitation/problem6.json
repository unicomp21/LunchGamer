  "question": "Two spherical objects with masses of 10 kg and 20 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (Assume G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3.34 × 10^-10 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "1.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "3.34 × 10^-9 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects can be calculated using Newton's law of gravitation: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 20 kg) / (2 m)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (200 kg^2) / (4 m^2)\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (50 kg^2/m^2)\nF = 3.335 × 10^-9 N⋅m^2/m^2\nF ≈ 1.67 × 10^-9 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 1.67 × 10^-9 N."
