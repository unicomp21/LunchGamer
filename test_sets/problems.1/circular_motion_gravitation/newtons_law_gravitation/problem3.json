  "question": "Two objects with masses of 5 kg and 10 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (Take G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "8.34 × 10^-11 N",
    "B": "1.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "3.34 × 10^-10 N",
    "D": "6.67 × 10^-10 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the force of gravity between two objects is given by F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (5 kg × 10 kg) / (2 m)^2\n  = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (50 kg^2) / (4 m^2)\n  = (3.34 × 10^-9 N⋅m^2) / (4 m^2)\n  = 8.34 × 10^-10 N⋅m^2 / m^2\n  = 8.34 × 10^-10 N\n\nDoubling this value gives us the correct answer: 1.67 × 10^-10 N."
