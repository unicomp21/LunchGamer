  "question": "Two spherical objects, each with a mass of 10 kg, are placed 1 meter apart. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.67 × 10^-11 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "6.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "6.67 × 10^-8 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects is given by F = G × m1 × m2 / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Plugging in the given values, we get: F = (6.67 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (10 kg) × (10 kg) / (1 m)^2 = 6.67 × 10^-10 N. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B."
