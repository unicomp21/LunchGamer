  "question": "A block of mass 5 kg is placed on a frictionless inclined plane that makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal. What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the plane on the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "25 N",
    "B": "43.3 N",
    "C": "50 N",
    "D": "61.2 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The free body diagram shows the normal force N and the weight mg of the block. As the plane is frictionless, the only forces acting are the normal force and the component of weight perpendicular to the surface. Using the equation N = mgcos(θ), where m is the mass (5 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and θ is the angle of inclination (30°), we get: N = 5 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × cos(30°) ≈ 43.3 N."
