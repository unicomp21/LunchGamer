  "question": "A 1.5 kg ball is attached to a string and swung in a horizontal circular path with a radius of 0.8 m. If the ball makes one complete revolution in 1.2 seconds, what is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.3 N",
    "B": "2.6 N",
    "C": "3.9 N",
    "D": "5.2 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The tension in the string is equal to the centripetal force acting on the ball. The formula for centripetal force is F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the ball, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circular path. To find the velocity, we can use v = 2πr/T, where T is the period of revolution. Given: m = 1.5 kg, r = 0.8 m, T = 1.2 s. First, calculate the velocity: v = 2π(0.8 m)/(1.2 s) ≈ 4.19 m/s. Now, plug this into the centripetal force equation: F_c = (1.5 kg)(4.19 m/s)^2/(0.8 m) ≈ 3.9 N. Therefore, the tension in the string is approximately 3.9 N."
