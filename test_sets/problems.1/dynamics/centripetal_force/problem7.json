  "question": "A 1.5 kg object is attached to a string and rotates in a horizontal circle with a radius of 0.8 m. If the string breaks when the tension exceeds 50 N, what is the maximum speed at which the object can rotate without breaking the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "4.1 m/s",
    "B": "5.8 m/s",
    "C": "7.3 m/s",
    "D": "9.6 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The maximum tension in the string is equal to the centripetal force, given by F = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object, v is its speed, and r is the radius of the circle. Solving for v, we get v = √(Fr/m). Plugging in the values: m = 1.5 kg, r = 0.8 m, and F = 50 N, we get: v = √(50 N × 0.8 m / 1.5 kg) ≈ 5.8 m/s. Therefore, the maximum speed at which the object can rotate without breaking the string is approximately 5.8 m/s."
