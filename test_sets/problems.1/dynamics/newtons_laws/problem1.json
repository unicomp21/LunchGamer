  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed across a frictionless horizontal surface by a force of 10 N. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 m/s^2",
    "B": "5 m/s^2",
    "C": "10 m/s^2",
    "D": "20 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's second law, F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. In this case, the net force is the 10 N pushing force since the surface is frictionless. We can rearrange the equation to solve for acceleration: a = F / m. Plugging in the given values, we get a = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
