  "question": "A constant net force of 50 N is applied to a 5 kg block initially at rest on a frictionless surface. After 2 seconds, what is the speed of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "25 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Newton's second law, the acceleration (a) of an object is equal to the net force (F) divided by its mass (m), i.e., a = F / m. Here, F = 50 N and m = 5 kg, so the acceleration is a = 50 N / 5 kg = 10 m/s^2. Using the formula v = at, where v is the final velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time, we can calculate the speed of the block after 2 seconds: v = 10 m/s^2 Ã— 2 s = 20 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
