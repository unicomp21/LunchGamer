  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at a height of 5 m above the ground. Neglecting air resistance, what is the speed of the block just before it hits the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "50 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "By the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the block is converted entirely to kinetic energy just before hitting the ground (assuming no air resistance). Initial potential energy is given by PE = mgh, where m is mass (2 kg), g is acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2), and h is height (5 m). So, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 5 m = 100 J. This is equal to the final kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed just before hitting the ground. Setting them equal: 100 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2. Solving for v, we get v = √(100 J / 1 kg) = √(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s."
