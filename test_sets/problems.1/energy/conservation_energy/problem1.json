  "question": "A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 5 meters. Neglecting air resistance, what is the speed of the ball just before it hits the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "25 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the ball is converted into kinetic energy just before hitting the ground. The initial potential energy is calculated as PE = mgh, where m is the mass (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2), and h is the height (5 m). Thus, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 5 m = 100 J. By conservation of energy, this equals the final kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed just before hitting the ground. Solving for v, we get: 100 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2, which simplifies to v^2 = 100 m^2/s^2, and taking the square root of both sides yields v = 10 m/s."
