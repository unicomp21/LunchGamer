  "question": "A 5 kg box slides down a frictionless ramp from a height of 3 m. What is the speed of the box when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5.4 m/s",
    "B": "7.7 m/s",
    "C": "10.2 m/s",
    "D": "12.6 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the box. Here, the work is done by gravity. The initial kinetic energy is zero (as the box starts from rest), and the final kinetic energy is 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the final speed.\n\nThe work done by gravity is W = m * g * h, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and h is the height.\n\nThus, m * g * h = 1/2 * m * v^2\n\nSolving for v:\nv = sqrt(2 * g * h) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 3 m) â‰ˆ 7.7 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the box at the bottom of the ramp is approximately 7.7 m/s."
