  "question": "A 2 kg block is initially at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface. A constant horizontal force of 10 N is applied to the block, causing it to move a distance of 5 m. What is the change in the block's kinetic energy?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "25 J",
    "B": "50 J",
    "C": "100 J",
    "D": "200 J"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the net work is done by the constant horizontal force. The work done by the force is calculated as W = F × d, where F is the force (10 N) and d is the displacement (5 m). Thus, W = 10 N × 5 m = 50 J. Since the block starts from rest (initial kinetic energy is zero) and there are no other forces acting on it, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by the force. Therefore, the change in the block's kinetic energy is 50 J."
