  "question": "A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 20 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the maximum speed of the mass as it oscillates?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 m/s",
    "B": "0.4 m/s",
    "C": "0.8 m/s",
    "D": "1.6 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The maximum speed of the mass occurs at the equilibrium position, where all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy at the maximum displacement is given by PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant (20 N/m) and x is the displacement (0.1 m). Thus, PE = (1/2)(20 N/m)(0.1 m)^2 = 0.1 J. By the law of conservation of energy, this potential energy is equal to the maximum kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass (0.5 kg) and v is the maximum speed. Setting PE equal to KE and solving for v: (1/2)(20 N/m)(0.1 m)^2 = (1/2)(0.5 kg)v^2, which gives v = 0.8 m/s."
