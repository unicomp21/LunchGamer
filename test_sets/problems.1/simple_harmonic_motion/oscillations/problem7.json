  "question": "A 2.0 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m and undergoes simple harmonic motion. What is the period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.20 s",
    "B": "0.40 s",
    "C": "0.63 s",
    "D": "1.26 s"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values, we get: T = 2π√(2.0 kg / 50 N/m) = 2π√(0.04 s^2) ≈ 1.26 s. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
