  "question": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. If the mass is displaced 10 cm from its equilibrium position and released, what is the period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.125 s",
    "B": "0.250 s",
    "C": "0.628 s",
    "D": "1.26 s"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system can be calculated using the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values:\n\nT = 2π√(2 kg / 50 N/m)\nT = 2π√(0.04 s^2)\nT = 2π(0.2 s)\nT = 1.26 s\n\nTherefore, the period of oscillation is 1.26 seconds, corresponding to answer choice D."
