  "question": "A car moving at a constant speed of 30 m/s is approaching a stationary observer. The car's horn emits a sound at a frequency of 440 Hz. If the speed of sound is 340 m/s, what frequency does the observer hear as the car approaches?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "400 Hz",
    "B": "415 Hz",
    "C": "477 Hz",
    "D": "523 Hz"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect formula for an approaching source is f_observed = f_source * (v_sound + v_observer) / (v_sound - v_source), where f_observed is the frequency heard by the observer, f_source is the original frequency emitted by the source, v_sound is the speed of sound, v_observer is the speed of the observer relative to the medium (in this case, the observer is stationary, so v_observer = 0), and v_source is the speed of the source relative to the medium. Plugging in the values, we get: f_observed = 440 Hz * (340 m/s + 0 m/s) / (340 m/s - 30 m/s) = 440 Hz * 340 m/s / 310 m/s â‰ˆ 477 Hz. Therefore, the observer hears a frequency of approximately 477 Hz as the car approaches."
