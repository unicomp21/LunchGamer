  "question": "A train moving at a speed of 30 m/s relative to the ground blows its whistle, which emits sound at a frequency of 500 Hz. If the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s, what frequency would an observer hear if they were standing on the platform as the train approaches?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "459 Hz",
    "B": "500 Hz",
    "C": "544 Hz",
    "D": "588 Hz"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect formula for an approaching source is f_obs = f_src * (v_sound / (v_sound - v_src)), where f_obs is the observed frequency, f_src is the source frequency, v_sound is the speed of sound, and v_src is the speed of the source relative to the observer. Plugging in the values, we get: f_obs = 500 Hz * (343 m/s / (343 m/s - 30 m/s)) â‰ˆ 544 Hz. Therefore, the observer would hear a frequency of approximately 544 Hz."
