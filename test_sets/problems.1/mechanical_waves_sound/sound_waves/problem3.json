  "question": "A sound wave traveling through air at 343 m/s has a frequency of 2.5 kHz. What is the wavelength of this sound wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.0686 m",
    "B": "0.1372 m",
    "C": "0.0343 m",
    "D": "0.1715 m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The wavelength of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and 位 is the wavelength. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength: 位 = v / f. Substituting the given values: 位 = 343 m/s / 2500 Hz = 343 m/s / 2500 s^-1 = 0.1372 m. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
