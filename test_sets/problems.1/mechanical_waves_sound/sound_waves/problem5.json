  "question": "A sound wave traveling through air has a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m. What is the speed of sound in air?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "170 m/s",
    "B": "250 m/s",
    "C": "340 m/s",
    "D": "680 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of sound can be calculated using the wave equation v = fλ, where v is the speed of the wave, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Substituting the given values: v = 500 Hz × 0.68 m = 340 m/s. Therefore, the speed of sound in air under these conditions is 340 m/s."
