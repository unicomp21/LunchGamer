  "question": "A wave travels along a string with a frequency of 20 Hz and a wavelength of 0.5 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave speed equation: v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Given the frequency of 20 Hz and the wavelength of 0.5 m, we can calculate the wave speed as follows: v = 20 Hz × 0.5 m = 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 10 m/s."
