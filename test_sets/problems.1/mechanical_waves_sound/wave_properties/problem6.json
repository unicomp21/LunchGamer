  "question": "A transverse wave on a string has a frequency of 100 Hz and a wavelength of 0.5 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "20 m/s",
    "B": "50 m/s",
    "C": "100 m/s",
    "D": "200 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Given f = 100 Hz and λ = 0.5 m, we can calculate the wave speed: v = (100 Hz)(0.5 m) = 50 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B, 50 m/s."
