  "question": "A wave traveling along a string has a frequency of 20 Hz and a wavelength of 0.5 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed (v) of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = fλ, where f is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. Plugging in the given values, we get: v = 20 Hz × 0.5 m = 10 m/s. Therefore, the speed of the wave is 10 m/s."
