  "question": "A transverse wave is traveling along a rope with a speed of 12 m/s. If the frequency of the wave is 60 Hz, what is the wavelength of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.1 m",
    "B": "0.2 m",
    "C": "0.3 m",
    "D": "0.4 m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The wavelength of a wave can be found using the wave equation: v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength: λ = v / f. Substituting the given values: λ = 12 m/s / 60 Hz = 0.2 m. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
