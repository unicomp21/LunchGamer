  "question": "Two positive point charges, q1 = 3 nC and q2 = 5 nC, are separated by a distance of 20 cm. What is the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3.38 × 10^-5 N",
    "B": "6.75 × 10^-5 N",
    "C": "1.35 × 10^-4 N",
    "D": "2.70 × 10^-4 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges can be found using Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Converting the units, q1 = 3 × 10^-9 C, q2 = 5 × 10^-9 C, and r = 0.2 m. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (3 × 10^-9 C) * (5 × 10^-9 C) / (0.2 m)^2 = 1.35 × 10^-4 N. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
