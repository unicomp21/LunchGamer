  "question": "Two point charges, +4 nC and -2 nC, are separated by a distance of 3 cm. What is the magnitude of the electric field at a point halfway between the two charges?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.0 × 10^5 N/C",
    "B": "4.0 × 10^5 N/C",
    "C": "6.0 × 10^5 N/C",
    "D": "8.0 × 10^5 N/C"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electric field at a point due to a point charge can be found using Coulomb's law: E = kq / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point. The net electric field is the vector sum of the fields due to each charge. At the midpoint, the fields due to the two charges point in the same direction, so we can simply add their magnitudes. The distance from each charge to the midpoint is half the total distance, or 1.5 cm (0.015 m). Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is: E = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) × [(4 × 10^-9 C) / (0.015 m)^2 + (2 × 10^-9 C) / (0.015 m)^2] = 6.0 × 10^5 N/C."
