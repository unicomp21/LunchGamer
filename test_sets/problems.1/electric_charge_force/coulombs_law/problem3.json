  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = 3 µC and q2 = -6 µC, are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between them? (k = 9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.025 × 10^-3 N",
    "B": "4.050 × 10^-3 N",
    "C": "8.100 × 10^-3 N",
    "D": "1.620 × 10^-2 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using Coulomb's law, the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is given by F = k|q1||q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges (3 × 10^-6 C and -6 × 10^-6 C), and r is the distance between them (2 m). Substituting the values, we get: F = (9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) × (3 × 10^-6 C) × (6 × 10^-6 C) / (2 m)^2 = 8.1 × 10^-3 N. The negative sign of q2 indicates an attractive force, but the question asks for the magnitude, so the answer is 8.100 × 10^-3 N."
