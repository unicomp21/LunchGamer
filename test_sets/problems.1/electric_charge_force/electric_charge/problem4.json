  "question": "Two small spheres, each with a mass of 0.1 kg, are suspended by light strings from a common point. The spheres each have a charge of +2 μC and are separated by a distance of 0.2 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between the two spheres? (k = 9.0 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "9.0 × 10^-4 N",
    "B": "9.0 × 10^-3 N",
    "C": "9.0 × 10^-2 N",
    "D": "9.0 × 10^-1 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The electric force between two charged objects can be calculated using Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (9.0 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), |q1| and |q2| are the magnitudes of the charges (both 2 × 10^-6 C), and r is the distance between the charges (0.2 m). Plugging in the values, we get: F = (9.0 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (2 × 10^-6 C) * (2 × 10^-6 C) / (0.2 m)^2 = 9.0 × 10^-3 N. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
