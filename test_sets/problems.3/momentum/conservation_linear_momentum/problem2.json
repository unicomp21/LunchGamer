  "question": "A 2 kg ball moving at 5 m/s collides head-on with a stationary 3 kg ball. After the collision, the 2 kg ball moves in the opposite direction at 2 m/s. What is the velocity of the 3 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s",
    "B": "2 m/s",
    "C": "3 m/s",
    "D": "4 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. Before the collision, only the 2 kg ball has momentum: p_i = m_1 * v_1 = 2 kg * 5 m/s = 10 kg⋅m/s. After the collision, both balls have momentum in opposite directions: p_f = m_1 * v_1' + m_2 * v_2'. Substituting the known values: 10 kg⋅m/s = 2 kg * (-2 m/s) + 3 kg * v_2'. Solve for v_2': v_2' = (10 kg⋅m/s + 2 kg * 2 m/s) / 3 kg = 14 kg⋅m/s / 3 kg ≈ 3.33 m/s. The closest answer is C, 3 m/s."
