  "question": "A 2 kg ball traveling at 5 m/s horizontally collides head-on with a stationary 3 kg ball. After the collision, the 2 kg ball moves horizontally at 2 m/s in the opposite direction. What is the velocity of the 3 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s",
    "B": "2 m/s",
    "C": "3 m/s",
    "D": "4 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Let's apply the law of conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is the momentum of the 2 kg ball: p_i = m_1 * v_1 = 2 kg * 5 m/s = 10 kg⋅m/s. After the collision, the final momentum is the sum of the momenta of both balls: p_f = m_1 * v'_1 + m_2 * v'_2, where v'_1 and v'_2 are the final velocities of the 2 kg and 3 kg balls, respectively. By conservation of momentum, p_i = p_f, so 10 kg⋅m/s = 2 kg * (-2 m/s) + 3 kg * v'_2. Solving for v'_2, we get: v'_2 = (10 kg⋅m/s - (-4 kg⋅m/s)) / 3 kg = 14 kg⋅m/s / 3 kg ≈ 4.67 m/s. The closest answer choice is C, 3 m/s."
