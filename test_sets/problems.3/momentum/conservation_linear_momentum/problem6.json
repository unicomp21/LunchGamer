  "question": "A 2 kg block moving at 5 m/s to the right collides and sticks to a 3 kg block initially at rest. What is the velocity of the combined blocks after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s to the left",
    "B": "1 m/s to the right",
    "C": "2 m/s to the left",
    "D": "2 m/s to the right"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Before the collision, only the 2 kg block has momentum: p_i = mv = (2 kg)(5 m/s) = 10 kg⋅m/s to the right. After the collision, the combined mass is 5 kg, so we can find the final velocity v_f using: p_f = (m_1 + m_2)v_f. Setting the initial and final momenta equal: 10 kg⋅m/s = (5 kg)v_f. Solving for v_f, we get: v_f = (10 kg⋅m/s) / (5 kg) = 2 m/s to the right. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
