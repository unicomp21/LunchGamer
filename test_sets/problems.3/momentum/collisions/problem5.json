  "question": "A 2 kg ball moving at 5 m/s collides head-on with a stationary 3 kg ball. After the collision, the 2 kg ball moves in the opposite direction at 2 m/s. What is the velocity of the 3 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s",
    "B": "2 m/s",
    "C": "3 m/s",
    "D": "4 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using conservation of momentum, the initial momentum of the system (p_i) equals the final momentum (p_f). The initial momentum is the momentum of the 2 kg ball: p_i = m_1 * v_1 = 2 kg * 5 m/s = 10 kg*m/s. The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of both balls: p_f = m_1 * v_1' + m_2 * v_2', where v_1' and v_2' are the final velocities of the balls. Setting these equal: 10 kg*m/s = 2 kg * (-2 m/s) + 3 kg * v_2'. Solving for v_2', we get: v_2' = (10 kg*m/s + 2 kg * 2 m/s) / 3 kg = 14 kg*m/s / 3 kg â‰ˆ 3 m/s (after rounding to the nearest integer). Therefore, the velocity of the 3 kg ball after the collision is 3 m/s."
