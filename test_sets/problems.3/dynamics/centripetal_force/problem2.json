  "question": "A 1000 kg car travels at a constant speed of 20 m/s around a circular track with a radius of 50 m. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the car?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2000 N",
    "B": "4000 N",
    "C": "8000 N",
    "D": "16000 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The centripetal force can be calculated using the formula F = mv^2 / r, where m is the mass of the car (1000 kg), v is the speed of the car (20 m/s), and r is the radius of the circular track (50 m). Plugging in the values, we get: F = (1000 kg)(20 m/s)^2 / (50 m) = 8000 N. Therefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the car is 8000 N."
