  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed across a frictionless horizontal surface with a force of 10 N. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 m/s^2",
    "B": "5 m/s^2",
    "C": "10 m/s^2",
    "D": "20 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this is expressed as a = F / m, where a is acceleration, F is the net force, and m is mass. In this problem, the net force is the 10 N push, and the mass is 2 kg. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: a = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
