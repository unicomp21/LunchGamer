  "question": "A 10 kg box is pushed across a horizontal surface with a force of 50 N at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface is 0.2, what is the acceleration of the box? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 m/s^2",
    "B": "3.0 m/s^2",
    "C": "3.5 m/s^2",
    "D": "4.0 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "First, find the normal force (N) using the equation N = mg = 10 kg × 10 m/s^2 = 100 N. The friction force (f) is given by f = μN = 0.2 × 100 N = 20 N. Resolve the applied force into horizontal (Fx) and vertical (Fy) components: Fx = 50 N × cos(30°) ≈ 43.3 N, Fy = 50 N × sin(30°) = 25 N. The net force in the horizontal direction is Fnet = Fx - f = 43.3 N - 20 N = 23.3 N. Using Newton's second law, Fnet = ma, we can find the acceleration: a = Fnet / m = 23.3 N / 10 kg ≈ 2.33 m/s^2. Rounding to the nearest 0.5 m/s^2, the correct answer is C: 3.5 m/s^2."
