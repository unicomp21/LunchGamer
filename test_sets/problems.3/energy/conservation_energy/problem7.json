  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless ramp that is 5 meters long and 3 meters high. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6 m/s",
    "B": "7.7 m/s",
    "C": "9.8 m/s",
    "D": "12 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy (PE) of the block is converted entirely to kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom of the ramp, assuming no friction. The initial PE is calculated as mgh, where m is the mass (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the ramp (3 m). Thus, PE = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × 3 m = 58.8 J.\n\nAt the bottom of the ramp, the PE is converted to KE, which is equal to (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the block. Setting the initial PE equal to the final KE:\n\n58.8 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2\n\nSolving for v:\n\nv^2 = 58.8 J ÷ (1 kg)\nv^2 = 58.8 m^2/s^2\nv = √(58.8 m^2/s^2) ≈ 7.7 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp is approximately 7.7 m/s."
