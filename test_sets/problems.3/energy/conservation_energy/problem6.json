  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless ramp that is 5 m high. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp? (Assume g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "By the conservation of energy, the initial gravitational potential energy of the block is converted entirely into kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp (assuming no friction). The initial potential energy is PE = mgh, where m = 2 kg, g = 10 m/s^2, and h = 5 m. So, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 5 m = 100 J. At the bottom, this is equal to the kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed we want to find. Setting this equal to the initial potential energy: (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2 = 100 J. Solving for v, we get v = √(2 × 100 J / 2 kg) = √(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s. Therefore, the speed at the bottom of the ramp is 10 m/s."
