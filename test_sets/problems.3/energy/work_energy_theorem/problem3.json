  "question": "A 2 kg box slides down a frictionless ramp from a height of 5 m. What is the speed of the box when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "7 m/s",
    "C": "10 m/s",
    "D": "14 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the net work done on the object. In this case, the work is done by gravity. The initial kinetic energy is zero (the box starts at rest), and the final kinetic energy is 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the final speed. The work done by gravity is m * g * h, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2) and h is the change in height. Setting these equal: m * g * h = 1/2 * m * v^2. Solving for v: v = sqrt(2 * g * h) = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 5 m) â‰ˆ 10 m/s."
