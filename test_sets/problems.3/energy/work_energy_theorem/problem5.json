  "question": "A 2 kg block initially at rest slides down a frictionless 5 m long ramp inclined at 30° to the horizontal. What is the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5.0 m/s",
    "B": "7.0 m/s",
    "C": "9.8 m/s",
    "D": "4.9 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the net work done on the block. Since the ramp is frictionless, the only work done is by gravity.\n\nThe change in gravitational potential energy is:\nΔU = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the vertical height.\nh = 5 m × sin(30°) = 2.5 m\nΔU = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s² × 2.5 m = 49 J\n\nFrom the work-energy theorem:\nΔK = W = ΔU = 49 J\n0.5 × 2 kg × v² - 0 = 49 J\nv² = 49 J ÷ (0.5 × 2 kg) = 49 m²/s²\nv = √(49 m²/s²) ≈ 7.0 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp is closest to 7.0 m/s, which corresponds to choice B."
