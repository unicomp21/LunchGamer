  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed 5 meters up a frictionless incline that makes a 30° angle with the horizontal. How much work is done on the block? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "50 J",
    "B": "100 J",
    "C": "50 N",
    "D": "100 N"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "The work done on the block is equal to the change in its gravitational potential energy. The change in height is Δh = 5 m × sin(30°) = 2.5 m. The change in gravitational potential energy is ΔU = mgΔh = (2 kg) × (10 m/s^2) × (2.5 m) = 50 J. Therefore, the work done on the block is 50 J."
