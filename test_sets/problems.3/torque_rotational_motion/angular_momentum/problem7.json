  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2.0 m and mass 5.0 kg rotates about an axis perpendicular to its length at one end. If the rod has an angular velocity of 4.0 rad/s, what is its angular momentum?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.7 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "B": "10 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "C": "13.3 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "D": "20 kg⋅m^2/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a rod rotating about an axis at one end is given by I = (1/3)ML^2, where M is the mass and L is the length of the rod. Plugging in the values, we get I = (1/3)(5.0 kg)(2.0 m)^2 = 6.67 kg⋅m^2. Angular momentum is defined as L = Iω, where ω is the angular velocity. Substituting the values, we get L = (6.67 kg⋅m^2)(4.0 rad/s) ≈ 13.3 kg⋅m^2/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
