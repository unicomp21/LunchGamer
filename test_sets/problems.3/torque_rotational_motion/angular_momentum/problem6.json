  "question": "A uniform solid disk of mass 5 kg and radius 0.5 m rotates about a fixed axis perpendicular to its center with an angular speed of 10 rad/s. What is the magnitude of the disk's angular momentum?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "B": "5.0 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "C": "6.25 kg⋅m^2/s",
    "D": "12.5 kg⋅m^2/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The angular momentum L of a rotating object is given by the formula L = I⋅ω, where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular speed. For a solid disk rotating about its center, the moment of inertia is I = (1/2)⋅m⋅r^2, where m is the mass and r is the radius. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nI = (1/2) × 5 kg × (0.5 m)^2 = 0.625 kg⋅m^2\n\nNow, we can calculate the angular momentum:\n\nL = 0.625 kg⋅m^2 × 10 rad/s = 6.25 kg⋅m^2/s\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 6.25 kg⋅m^2/s."
