  "question": "A uniform solid disk of radius 0.5 m and mass 10 kg rotates about a fixed axis through its center. If the disk starts from rest and experiences a constant angular acceleration of 4 rad/s^2, what is the magnitude of the net torque acting on the disk?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 N·m",
    "B": "5.0 N·m",
    "C": "10 N·m",
    "D": "20 N·m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a solid disk is given by I = (1/2) * m * r^2, where m is the mass and r is the radius. Substituting the given values, we get I = (1/2) * 10 kg * (0.5 m)^2 = 1.25 kg·m^2. The net torque τ is related to the moment of inertia I and angular acceleration α by τ = I * α. Plugging in the values, we find τ = 1.25 kg·m^2 * 4 rad/s^2 = 5.0 N·m. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
