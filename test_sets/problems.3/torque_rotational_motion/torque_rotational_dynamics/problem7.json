  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2 m and mass 5 kg is free to rotate about a frictionless pivot at one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot. What is the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 rad/s^2",
    "B": "2 rad/s^2",
    "C": "3 rad/s^2",
    "D": "4 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The angular acceleration can be found using the formula α = τ / I, where τ is the torque and I is the moment of inertia. The torque is given by τ = F × r, where F is the applied force (10 N) and r is the perpendicular distance from the pivot (0.5 m). Thus, τ = 10 N × 0.5 m = 5 N·m. The moment of inertia for a uniform rod pivoting about one end is I = (1/3) × m × L^2, where m is the mass (5 kg) and L is the length (2 m). Thus, I = (1/3) × 5 kg × (2 m)^2 = 20/3 kg·m^2. Substituting these values into the angular acceleration formula, we get α = 5 N·m / (20/3 kg·m^2) = 3/4 rad/s^2 ≈ 3 rad/s^2."
