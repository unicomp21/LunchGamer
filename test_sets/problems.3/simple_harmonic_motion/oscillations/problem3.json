  "question": "A mass attached to a spring oscillates with a period of 2 seconds. If the mass is doubled, what will be the new period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 second",
    "B": "√2 seconds",
    "C": "2 seconds",
    "D": "2√2 seconds"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. If the mass is doubled, the new mass is 2m. The new period is then T_new = 2π√(2m/k) = 2π√(2)√(m/k). Since T = 2π√(m/k) = 2 seconds, we can substitute: T_new = 2π√(2)√(m/k) = √2 * 2π√(m/k) = √2 * 2 seconds = 2√2 seconds. Therefore, if the mass is doubled, the new period will be 2√2 seconds."
