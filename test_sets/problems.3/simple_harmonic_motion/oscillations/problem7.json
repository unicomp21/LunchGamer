  "question": "A mass attached to a spring oscillates with a period of 2 seconds. If the mass is doubled and the spring constant remains the same, what is the new period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 second",
    "B": "√2 seconds",
    "C": "2 seconds",
    "D": "2√2 seconds"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. When the mass is doubled (m → 2m) and the spring constant remains the same, the new period becomes:\n\nT_new = 2π√((2m)/k) = 2π√(2(m/k)) = √2 * 2π√(m/k) = √2 * T_original\n\nSince the original period was 2 seconds, the new period is:\n\nT_new = √2 * 2 seconds = 2√2 seconds"
