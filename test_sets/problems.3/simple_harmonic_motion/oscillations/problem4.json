  "question": "A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 20 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released from rest. What is the maximum speed of the mass as it oscillates?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 m/s",
    "B": "0.4 m/s",
    "C": "0.8 m/s",
    "D": "1.6 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The maximum speed of an oscillating mass on a spring occurs at the equilibrium position. We can find this speed using the principle of conservation of energy. At maximum displacement, the mass has only potential energy: PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. This potential energy is converted to kinetic energy at the equilibrium position: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the speed. Equating the potential and kinetic energies: (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)mv^2. Solving for v: v = √(kx^2/m). Plugging in the given values: v = √((20 N/m)(0.1 m)^2 / (0.5 kg)) = √(0.4) ≈ 0.8 m/s."
