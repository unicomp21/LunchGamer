  "question": "A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 20 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.314 s",
    "B": "0.628 s",
    "C": "1.57 s",
    "D": "3.14 s"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "The period of oscillation for a mass-spring system can be found using the formula T = 2π * sqrt(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\nT = 2π * sqrt(0.5 kg / 20 N/m)\n  = 2π * sqrt(0.025 s^2)\n  = 2π * 0.158 s\n  = 0.314 s (to 3 significant figures)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 0.314 s."
