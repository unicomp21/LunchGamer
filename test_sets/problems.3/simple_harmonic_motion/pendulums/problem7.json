  "question": "A simple pendulum has a period of 2 seconds. If the length of the pendulum is doubled, what will be its new period?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 second",
    "B": "2 seconds",
    "C": "2√2 seconds",
    "D": "4 seconds"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. If the length is doubled, the new period will be T_new = 2π√(2L/g). Since the period is proportional to the square root of the length, doubling the length will multiply the period by a factor of √2. Thus, the new period will be T_new = 2√2 seconds."
