  "question": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a horizontal spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.2 m from equilibrium and released from rest. What is the maximum speed of the mass as it oscillates?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s",
    "B": "2 m/s",
    "C": "3 m/s",
    "D": "4 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position, where all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy stored in the spring at maximum displacement is PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. So PE = 0.5 * 50 N/m * (0.2 m)^2 = 1 J. By conservation of energy, this equals the maximum kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the maximum speed. Solving for v: 1 J = 0.5 * 2 kg * v^2, so v = sqrt(1 J / (0.5 * 2 kg)) = sqrt(1 J / 1 kg) = sqrt(1 m^2/s^2) = 1 m/s. Doubling this gives the total speed from one extreme to the other, so the maximum speed is 2 m/s."
