  "question": "A wave travels through a medium with a frequency of 20 Hz and a wavelength of 1.5 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "10 m/s",
    "B": "20 m/s",
    "C": "30 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be found using the wave speed equation: v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Substituting the given values, we get: v = 20 Hz × 1.5 m = 30 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 30 m/s."
