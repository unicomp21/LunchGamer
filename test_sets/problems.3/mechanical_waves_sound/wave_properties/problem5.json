  "question": "A sound wave traveling through air has a frequency of 440 Hz and a wavelength of 0.75 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "110 m/s",
    "B": "220 m/s",
    "C": "330 m/s",
    "D": "440 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = fλ, where v is the speed of the wave, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Substituting the given values, we get: v = 440 Hz × 0.75 m = 330 m/s. Therefore, the speed of the sound wave is 330 m/s."
