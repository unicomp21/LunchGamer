  "question": "A wave with a frequency of 20 Hz is traveling along a string. If the distance between two adjacent crests is 0.5 m, what is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the equation v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. The wavelength is the distance between two adjacent crests, which is given as 0.5 m. Plugging in the values, we get: v = 20 Hz × 0.5 m = 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
