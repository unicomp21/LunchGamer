  "question": "A stationary observer hears a car's horn as the car moves toward the observer at a constant velocity. Compared to the sound emitted by the car horn, the sound heard by the observer has a",
  "choices": {
    "A": "lower frequency and longer wavelength",
    "B": "lower frequency and shorter wavelength",
    "C": "higher frequency and longer wavelength",
    "D": "higher frequency and shorter wavelength"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Due to the Doppler effect, when a sound source is moving toward a stationary observer, the observer perceives the sound to have a higher frequency and shorter wavelength compared to the sound emitted by the source. This is because the sound waves are compressed in the direction of motion, resulting in a shorter wavelength and higher frequency. The relationship between frequency and wavelength is given by the equation v = fλ, where v is the speed of sound, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. As the car approaches the observer, the wavelength decreases, and since the speed of sound remains constant, the frequency must increase."
