  "question": "An ambulance with its siren blaring at a frequency of 400 Hz is approaching a stationary observer at a speed of 30 m/s. If the speed of sound in air is 340 m/s, what frequency does the observer hear as the ambulance approaches?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "365 Hz",
    "B": "400 Hz",
    "C": "435 Hz",
    "D": "470 Hz"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect equation for an approaching source is f_observed = f_source * (v_sound + v_observer) / (v_sound - v_source), where f_observed is the frequency heard by the observer, f_source is the original frequency of the source (400 Hz), v_sound is the speed of sound in air (340 m/s), v_observer is the speed of the observer relative to the medium (0 m/s since the observer is stationary), and v_source is the speed of the source relative to the medium (30 m/s). Plugging in the values, we get: f_observed = 400 Hz * (340 m/s + 0 m/s) / (340 m/s - 30 m/s) â‰ˆ 435 Hz. Therefore, the observer hears a frequency of about 435 Hz as the ambulance approaches."
