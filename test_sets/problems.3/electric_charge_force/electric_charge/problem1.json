  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +4 nC and q2 = -6 nC, are separated by a distance of 0.3 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.8 N",
    "B": "1.2 N",
    "C": "1.6 N",
    "D": "2.4 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. Substituting the values: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (4 × 10^-9 C) * (6 × 10^-9 C) / (0.3 m)^2 ≈ 1.6 N. The magnitude of the force is 1.6 N, so the correct answer is C."
