  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +2 nC and q2 = -4 nC, are separated by a distance of 0.3 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between the two charges?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.8 N",
    "B": "1.6 N",
    "C": "2.4 N",
    "D": "3.2 N"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's Law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. Plugging in the values: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (2 × 10^-9 C) * (4 × 10^-9 C) / (0.3 m)^2 = 0.8 N. The negative sign in q2 only indicates the direction of the force, not its magnitude."
