  "question": "Two positive point charges, each with a charge of +Q, are separated by a distance r. If the distance between the charges is doubled, what happens to the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "The force is doubled",
    "B": "The force is halved",
    "C": "The force is reduced to one-fourth",
    "D": "The force is increased by a factor of four"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: F = k * |Q1| * |Q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, |Q1| and |Q2| are the magnitudes of the charges, and r is the distance between them. If the distance is doubled (r becomes 2r), the force will be: F_new = k * |Q| * |Q| / (2r)^2 = k * |Q|^2 / 4r^2 = (1/4) * (k * |Q|^2 / r^2) = (1/4) * F_original. Therefore, the force is reduced to one-fourth of its original value when the distance is doubled."
