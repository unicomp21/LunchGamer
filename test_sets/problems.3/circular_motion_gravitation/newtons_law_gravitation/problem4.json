  "question": "Two spherical objects with masses of 10 kg and 40 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "B": "3.34 × 10^-9 N",
    "C": "6.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "1.33 × 10^-8 N"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects is given by the formula F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 40 kg) / (2 m)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × 400 kg^2 / 4 m^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 × 400) / 4 N\nF = 6.67 × 10^-9 / 4 N\nF = 1.67 × 10^-9 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.67 × 10^-9 N."
