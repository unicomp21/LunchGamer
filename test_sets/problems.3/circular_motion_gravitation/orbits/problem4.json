  "question": "A satellite orbits the Earth at an altitude of 500 km above the surface. If the radius of the Earth is 6,400 km, what is the orbital period of the satellite?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5,800 s",
    "B": "6,100 s",
    "C": "6,400 s",
    "D": "6,700 s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The orbital period T can be calculated using the formula T = 2π√(r³/GM), where r is the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite, G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²), and M is the mass of the Earth (5.97 × 10²⁴ kg). The distance r is the sum of the Earth's radius and the satellite's altitude: r = 6,400 km + 500 km = 6,900 km = 6.9 × 10⁶ m. Plugging in the values, we get: T = 2π√((6.9 × 10⁶ m)³ / (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² × 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg)) ≈ 6,100 s. Therefore, the orbital period of the satellite is closest to 6,100 s."
