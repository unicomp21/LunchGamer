  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite? (Use g = 9.8 m/s^2 and the radius of Earth = 6400 km)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "306 N",
    "B": "612 N",
    "C": "1225 N",
    "D": "2450 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The centripetal force on a satellite in uniform circular motion is provided by Earth's gravity. The magnitude of this force is F = GMm/r^2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.67 x 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2), M is Earth's mass, m is the satellite's mass, and r is the distance between the center of Earth and the satellite. To find Earth's mass, use the equation g = GM/R^2, where g is 9.8 m/s^2 and R is Earth's radius (6400 km). Solving for M yields M = gR^2/G = 5.97 x 10^24 kg. Now, plug in the values: F = (6.67 x 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)(5.97 x 10^24 kg)(500 kg)/(8000 km)^2. Converting km to m (8000 km = 8 x 10^6 m), we get F = 1225 N. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
