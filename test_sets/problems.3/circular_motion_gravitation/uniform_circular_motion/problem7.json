  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. What is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite? (Take the mass of Earth as 6.0 × 10^24 kg and the gravitational constant G as 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.6 × 10^3 N",
    "B": "4.2 × 10^3 N",
    "C": "6.7 × 10^3 N",
    "D": "8.3 × 10^3 N"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by gravity. Using Newton's law of universal gravitation, F = GMm/r^2, where M is the mass of Earth (6.0 × 10^24 kg), m is the mass of the satellite (500 kg), r is the radius of the orbit (8000 km or 8.0 × 10^6 m), and G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2). Plugging in the values:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (6.0 × 10^24 kg) × (500 kg) / (8.0 × 10^6 m)^2\nF ≈ 2.6 × 10^3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite is approximately 2.6 × 10^3 N."
