  "question": "A 0.5 kg object is attached to a string and swung in a horizontal circle of radius 1.2 m. If the object makes 2 complete revolutions per second, what is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "11.8 N",
    "B": "23.7 N",
    "C": "47.4 N",
    "D": "94.8 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. The formula for centripetal force is F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object, v is the tangential velocity, and r is the radius of the circular path.\n\nFirst, we need to find the tangential velocity. The object makes 2 revolutions per second, so the period T = 1/2 = 0.5 s. The circumference of the circle is C = 2πr = 2π(1.2 m) ≈ 7.54 m. The tangential velocity is v = C/T = 7.54 m / 0.5 s ≈ 15.1 m/s.\n\nNow we can calculate the tension:\nF_c = mv^2/r = (0.5 kg)(15.1 m/s)^2 / (1.2 m) ≈ 47.4 N.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 47.4 N."
