  "question": "A 1.2 kg ball is attached to a string and swung in a horizontal circle of radius 0.8 m. If the ball makes 2 complete revolutions per second, what is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "23.7 N",
    "B": "47.4 N",
    "C": "94.8 N",
    "D": "189.6 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force provides the necessary acceleration. The tension in the string acts as the centripetal force in this case. The centripetal acceleration is given by a = v^2 / r, where v is the tangential speed and r is the radius. The tangential speed can be found using v = 2πrf, where f is the frequency of revolution. Given f = 2 rev/s, v = 2π(0.8 m)(2 s^-1) ≈ 10.05 m/s. The centripetal acceleration is a = (10.05 m/s)^2 / (0.8 m) ≈ 126.3 m/s^2. Using Newton's second law, F = ma, the tension in the string equals the centripetal force: T = (1.2 kg)(126.3 m/s^2) ≈ 151.6 N. The closest answer choice is C, 94.8 N."
