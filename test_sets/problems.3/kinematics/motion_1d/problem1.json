  "question": "A ball is thrown straight up with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, what is the ball's velocity 3 seconds after it is thrown?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "9.4 m/s upward",
    "B": "9.4 m/s downward",
    "C": "10.6 m/s upward",
    "D": "10.6 m/s downward"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The ball's motion can be analyzed using the equation v = v0 - gt, where v is the final velocity, v0 is the initial velocity (20 m/s), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time (3 s). Substituting the values, we get: v = 20 m/s - (9.8 m/s^2)(3 s) = 20 m/s - 29.4 m/s = -9.4 m/s. The negative sign indicates that the ball is moving downward after 3 seconds, so the correct answer is B: 9.4 m/s downward."
