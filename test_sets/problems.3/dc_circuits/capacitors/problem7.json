  "question": "Two capacitors with capacitances C1 = 2 μF and C2 = 3 μF are connected in series to a 12 V battery. What is the equivalent capacitance of the series combination?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.2 μF",
    "B": "2.5 μF",
    "C": "5.0 μF",
    "D": "6.0 μF"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. Thus, 1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2. Substituting the given values, we get: 1/Ceq = 1/(2 μF) + 1/(3 μF) = 5/(6 μF). Solving for Ceq gives: Ceq = 6/5 μF = 1.2 μF. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
