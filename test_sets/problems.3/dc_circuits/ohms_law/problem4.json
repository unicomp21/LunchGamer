  "question": "A 12 V battery is connected to a 4 Ω resistor. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "3 A",
    "D": "4 A"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's Law, the current I through a resistor is given by I = V / R, where V is the voltage across the resistor and R is the resistance. In this case, V = 12 V and R = 4 Ω. Plugging these values into the equation, we get I = 12 V / 4 Ω = 3 A. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3 A."
