  "question": "A circuit consists of a 12 V battery connected to a 4 Ω resistor and a 6 Ω resistor in series. What is the current flowing through the 4 Ω resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 A",
    "B": "1.0 A",
    "C": "1.2 A",
    "D": "1.5 A"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances: R_total = 4 Ω + 6 Ω = 10 Ω. Using Ohm's law, V = IR, the current can be calculated as I = V / R_total = 12 V / 10 Ω = 1.2 A. Therefore, the current flowing through the 4 Ω resistor is also 1.2 A."
