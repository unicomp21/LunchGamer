  "question": "Three resistors with resistances of 3 Ω, 6 Ω, and 12 Ω are connected in parallel to a 9 V battery. What is the total current flowing from the battery?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "3 A",
    "D": "4 A"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "For resistors in parallel, the total resistance is given by 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. Plugging in the values, we get 1/Rtotal = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 4/6 + 3/6 + 1/6 = 8/6. Thus, Rtotal = 3/4 Ω. Using Ohm's law, I = V/R, the total current is I = 9 V / (3/4 Ω) = 12 A. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 4 A."
