  "question": "Two resistors with resistances R1 = 10 Ω and R2 = 20 Ω are connected in series to a 12 V battery. What is the current flowing through the 10 Ω resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 A",
    "B": "0.4 A",
    "C": "1.2 A",
    "D": "2.4 A"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "In a series circuit, the current is the same through all components. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances: R_total = R1 + R2 = 10 Ω + 20 Ω = 30 Ω. Using Ohm's law, V = IR, the current can be calculated as I = V / R_total = 12 V / 30 Ω = 0.4 A. Therefore, the current flowing through the 10 Ω resistor is also 0.4 A."
