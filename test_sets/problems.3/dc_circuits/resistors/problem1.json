  "question": "In a parallel circuit, three resistors with resistances of 2 Ω, 4 Ω, and 6 Ω are connected to a 12 V battery. What is the total current flowing through the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "6 A",
    "D": "12 A"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In a parallel circuit, the total resistance (Rtotal) is found using the formula 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3, where R1, R2, and R3 are the individual resistances. Plugging in the values, we get: 1/Rtotal = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 = 6/12 + 3/12 + 2/12 = 11/12. Thus, Rtotal = 12/11 Ω. Using Ohm's Law, I = V/R, we can calculate the total current: I = 12 V / (12/11 Ω) = 12 V * (11/12 Ω^-1) = 11 A * (12/12) = 11 A. The closest answer choice is C, 6 A."
