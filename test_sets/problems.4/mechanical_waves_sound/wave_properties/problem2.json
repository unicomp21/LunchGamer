  "question": "A sound wave traveling through air has a frequency of 440 Hz and a wavelength of 0.75 m. What is the speed of the sound wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "330 m/s",
    "B": "340 m/s",
    "C": "350 m/s",
    "D": "360 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be found using the formula v = fλ, where v is the speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Given a frequency of 440 Hz and a wavelength of 0.75 m, the speed can be calculated as follows: v = 440 Hz × 0.75 m = 330 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
