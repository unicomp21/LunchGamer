  "question": "A wave travels through a medium at a speed of 20 m/s with a frequency of 5 Hz. What is the wavelength of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m",
    "B": "2 m",
    "C": "4 m",
    "D": "100 m"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The wavelength can be found using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the wave speed (20 m/s), f is the frequency (5 Hz), and 位 is the wavelength. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength: 位 = v / f. Substituting the given values: 位 = 20 m/s / 5 Hz = 4 m. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 4 m."
