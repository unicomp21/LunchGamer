  "question": "A sound wave in air has a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m. What is the speed of this wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "170 m/s",
    "B": "250 m/s",
    "C": "340 m/s",
    "D": "500 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Given f = 500 Hz and λ = 0.68 m, we can calculate the speed as follows:\n\nv = fλ\nv = (500 Hz)(0.68 m)\nv = 340 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the sound wave is 340 m/s, which corresponds to answer choice C."
