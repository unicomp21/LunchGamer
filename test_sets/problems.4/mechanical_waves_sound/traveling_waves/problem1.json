  "question": "A transverse wave is traveling along a string with a frequency of 20 Hz and a wavelength of 0.5 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave speed equation: v = λf, where v is the wave speed, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Given the wavelength (0.5 m) and frequency (20 Hz), the wave speed can be calculated as follows: v = 0.5 m × 20 Hz = 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
