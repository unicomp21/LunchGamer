  "question": "A transverse wave is traveling along a string with a speed of 20 m/s. If the frequency of the wave is 10 Hz, what is the wavelength of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 m",
    "B": "1 m",
    "C": "2 m",
    "D": "4 m"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The wavelength can be calculated using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the wave speed (20 m/s), f is the frequency (10 Hz), and 位 is the wavelength. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength gives: 位 = v / f. Substituting the given values: 位 = 20 m/s / 10 Hz = 2 m. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 2 m."
