  "question": "A transverse wave is traveling along a string with a speed of 20 m/s. If the frequency of the wave is 50 Hz, what is the wavelength of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 m",
    "B": "0.4 m",
    "C": "1.0 m",
    "D": "2.5 m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The wavelength (位) of a wave can be found using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the wave speed and f is the frequency. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength: 位 = v / f. Substituting the given values, we get: 位 = 20 m/s / 50 Hz = 0.4 m. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.4 m."
