  "question": "A sound wave traveling through air has a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m. What is the speed of sound in air under these conditions?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "170 m/s",
    "B": "250 m/s",
    "C": "340 m/s",
    "D": "680 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave is related to its frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) by the equation v = fλ. Given the frequency of 500 Hz and wavelength of 0.68 m, we can calculate the speed:\n\nv = fλ\nv = (500 Hz)(0.68 m)\nv = 340 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of sound in air under these conditions is 340 m/s."
