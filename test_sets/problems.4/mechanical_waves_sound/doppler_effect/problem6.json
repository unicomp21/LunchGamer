  "question": "A police car with its siren on is approaching a stationary observer. The siren emits sound at a frequency of 1000 Hz. If the police car is moving at a speed of 30 m/s and the speed of sound is 340 m/s, what frequency does the observer hear as the police car approaches?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "915 Hz",
    "B": "1000 Hz",
    "C": "1088 Hz",
    "D": "1200 Hz"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect for a moving source and stationary observer is given by the formula f_obs = f_src * (v_sound / (v_sound - v_source)), where f_obs is the observed frequency, f_src is the source frequency, v_sound is the speed of sound, and v_source is the speed of the source. Plugging in the values, we get: f_obs = 1000 Hz * (340 m/s / (340 m/s - 30 m/s)) â‰ˆ 1088 Hz. Therefore, the observer hears a frequency of about 1088 Hz as the police car approaches."
