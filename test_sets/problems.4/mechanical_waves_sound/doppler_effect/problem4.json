  "question": "A train is moving toward a stationary observer at a constant speed of 30 m/s. The train blows its whistle, which emits a sound with a frequency of 500 Hz. If the speed of sound in air is 340 m/s, what frequency of sound does the observer hear as the train approaches?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "456 Hz",
    "B": "500 Hz",
    "C": "544 Hz",
    "D": "588 Hz"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect causes the frequency of the sound heard by the observer to change due to the relative motion between the source and the observer. When the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency heard by the observer is higher than the original frequency. The formula for the observed frequency (f') is given by: f' = f * (v + v_o) / (v - v_s), where f is the original frequency (500 Hz), v is the speed of sound in air (340 m/s), v_o is the speed of the observer (0 m/s, as the observer is stationary), and v_s is the speed of the source (30 m/s). Plugging in the values, we get: f' = 500 Hz * (340 m/s + 0 m/s) / (340 m/s - 30 m/s) â‰ˆ 588 Hz. Therefore, the observer hears a frequency of approximately 588 Hz as the train approaches."
