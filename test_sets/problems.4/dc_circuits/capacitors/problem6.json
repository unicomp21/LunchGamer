  "question": "Two capacitors with capacitances C1 and C2 are connected in series to a battery with voltage V. What is the equivalent capacitance of the series combination?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "C1 + C2",
    "B": "1 / (C1 + C2)",
    "C": "C1 * C2 / (C1 + C2)",
    "D": "(C1 * C2) / (C1 - C2)"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance (1/Ceq) is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances: 1/Ceq = 1/C1 + 1/C2. Solving this equation for Ceq yields: Ceq = 1 / (1/C1 + 1/C2) = (C1 * C2) / (C1 + C2). Therefore, the correct answer is choice C."
