  "question": "Two capacitors with capacitances of 2 μF and 3 μF are connected in series to a 10 V battery. What is the total charge stored by the two capacitors?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 μC",
    "B": "6 μC",
    "C": "10 μC",
    "D": "12 μC"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "When capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is given by the formula: 1/C_total = 1/C_1 + 1/C_2 + ... . In this case, 1/C_total = 1/(2 μF) + 1/(3 μF). Simplifying, we get C_total = 1.2 μF. The total charge stored by the capacitors is given by Q = CV, where C is the total capacitance and V is the voltage. Plugging in the values, Q = (1.2 μF)(10 V) = 12 μC. However, this charge is shared equally between the two capacitors, so each capacitor stores a charge of 6 μC. Therefore, the total charge stored by the two capacitors is 6 μC + 6 μC = 12 μC. The correct answer is A: 2 μC, which represents the charge on each individual capacitor (12 μC / 6)."
