  "question": "Three capacitors with capacitances of 3 μF, 6 μF, and 12 μF are connected in series. What is the equivalent capacitance of the combination?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 μF",
    "B": "2 μF",
    "C": "7 μF",
    "D": "21 μF"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "For capacitors connected in series, the reciprocal of the equivalent capacitance is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances. Therefore:\n\n1/C_eq = 1/C_1 + 1/C_2 + 1/C_3\n1/C_eq = 1/(3 μF) + 1/(6 μF) + 1/(12 μF)\n1/C_eq = 4/(12 μF) + 2/(12 μF) + 1/(12 μF)\n1/C_eq = 7/(12 μF)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\nC_eq = (12 μF)/7\nC_eq ≈ 1.71 μF\n\nRounding to the nearest answer choice, the equivalent capacitance is 1 μF (Choice A)."
