  "question": "In the circuit shown, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is 3 A. What is the value of the unknown resistor R?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 Ω",
    "B": "2 Ω",
    "C": "3 Ω",
    "D": "4 Ω"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Using Kirchhoff's current law, the current through the unknown resistor R must be equal to the current through the 2 Ω resistor, which is given as 3 A. The potential difference across the parallel combination of resistors is the same as the potential difference across the 12 V battery. Thus, the voltage across R is also 12 V. Using Ohm's law, V = IR, we can find the resistance of R:\n\n12 V = (3 A)(R)\nR = 12 V / 3 A = 4 Ω\n\nTherefore, the value of the unknown resistor R is 4 Ω."
