  "question": "Three resistors with resistances of 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω are connected in parallel to a 12 V battery. What is the total current drawn from the battery?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "4 A",
    "D": "11 A"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is found using the formula 1/R_total = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3. Plugging in the values, we get: 1/R_total = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 + 4/6 + 1/6 = 11/6 Ω. To find the total current, we use Ohm's Law: I_total = V/R_total = 12 V / (11/6 Ω) = 12 V * (6/11 Ω) = 72/11 A ≈ 6.55 A. The closest answer choice is D, 11 A."
