  "question": "Three resistors with resistances of 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω are connected in parallel to a 12 V battery. What is the total current flowing through the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 A",
    "B": "2 A",
    "C": "4 A",
    "D": "11 A"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is given by 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. Substituting the given values, we get 1/Rtotal = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 6/6 + 4/6 + 1/6 = 11/6 Ω. To find the total current, we use Ohm's law: I = V/R, where V is the voltage (12 V) and R is the total resistance (6/11 Ω). Thus, I = 12 V / (6/11 Ω) = 12 V • (11/6) = 22 A. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 11 A."
