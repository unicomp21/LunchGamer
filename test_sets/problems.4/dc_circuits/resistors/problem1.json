  "question": "In a series circuit with three resistors, R1 = 10 Ω, R2 = 20 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω, what is the equivalent resistance of the circuit?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "10 Ω",
    "B": "20 Ω",
    "C": "30 Ω",
    "D": "60 Ω"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "In a series circuit, the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. Thus, the equivalent resistance (Req) is given by: Req = R1 + R2 + R3. Substituting the given values, Req = 10 Ω + 20 Ω + 30 Ω = 60 Ω."
