  "question": "A 12 V battery is connected to a resistor, causing a current of 3 A to flow through the resistor. What is the resistance of the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 Ω",
    "B": "2 Ω",
    "C": "4 Ω",
    "D": "6 Ω"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's Law, V = IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. Rearranging the equation to solve for resistance, we get R = V / I. Plugging in the given values, R = 12 V / 3 A = 4 Ω."
