  "question": "A resistor with a resistance of 10 Ω is connected to a battery with a voltage of 5 V. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 A",
    "B": "0.5 A",
    "C": "2 A",
    "D": "5 A"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's law, the current (I) through a resistor is equal to the voltage (V) across the resistor divided by its resistance (R), so I = V / R. With V = 5 V and R = 10 Ω, we have I = 5 V / 10 Ω = 0.5 A."
