  "question": "A resistor with a resistance of 10 Ω is connected to a battery with a voltage of 5 V. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 A",
    "B": "0.5 A",
    "C": "2 A",
    "D": "50 A"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's Law, the current I through a resistor is directly proportional to the voltage V across the resistor and inversely proportional to the resistance R of the resistor. The formula is I = V / R. In this case, the voltage is 5 V and the resistance is 10 Ω. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: I = 5 V / 10 Ω = 0.5 A. Therefore, the correct answer is B, 0.5 A."
