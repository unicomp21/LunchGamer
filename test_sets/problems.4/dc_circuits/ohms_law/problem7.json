  "question": "In a simple DC circuit, a 12 V battery is connected to a resistor with a resistance of 6 Ω. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 A",
    "B": "1 A",
    "C": "2 A",
    "D": "3 A"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's law, the current I flowing through a resistor is given by I = V / R, where V is the voltage across the resistor and R is the resistance. In this case, V = 12 V and R = 6 Ω. Substituting these values into the equation, we get I = 12 V / 6 Ω = 2 A. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 2 A."
