  "question": "A 1.2 kg ball is attached to a string and swung in a horizontal circular path with a radius of 0.8 m. If the ball makes one complete revolution every 1.5 seconds, what is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.1 N",
    "B": "3.4 N",
    "C": "4.2 N",
    "D": "5.6 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The tension in the string provides the centripetal force required for circular motion. The formula for centripetal force is F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the ball, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circular path. The velocity can be found using v = 2πr/T, where T is the period of revolution.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the ball, m = 1.2 kg\n- Radius of the circular path, r = 0.8 m\n- Period of revolution, T = 1.5 s\n\nStep 1: Calculate the velocity of the ball.\nv = 2πr/T\nv = 2π × 0.8 m / 1.5 s\nv ≈ 3.35 m/s\n\nStep 2: Calculate the centripetal force (tension in the string).\nF_c = mv^2/r\nF_c = 1.2 kg × (3.35 m/s)^2 / 0.8 m\nF_c ≈ 16.8 N / 0.8 m\nF_c ≈ 4.2 N\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string is approximately 4.2 N (choice C)."
