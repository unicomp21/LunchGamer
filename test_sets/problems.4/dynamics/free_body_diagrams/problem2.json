  "question": "A block of mass 5 kg is pulled along a horizontal frictionless surface by a force of 20 N at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.0 m/s^2",
    "B": "3.0 m/s^2",
    "C": "3.5 m/s^2",
    "D": "4.0 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "To find the acceleration, we need to determine the net force acting on the block using the free body diagram. The forces acting on the block are the applied force (20 N) and the normal force. Since the surface is frictionless, there is no friction force.\n\nThe horizontal component of the applied force is F_x = 20 cos(30°) ≈ 17.3 N.\n\nUsing Newton's Second Law, F_net = ma, we have:\n\n17.3 N = 5 kg × a\n\nSolving for acceleration (a):\n\na = 17.3 N / 5 kg ≈ 3.5 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the block is approximately 3.5 m/s^2."
