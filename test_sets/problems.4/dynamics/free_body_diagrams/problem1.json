  "question": "A block of mass 5 kg is placed on a frictionless incline that makes an angle of 30° with the horizontal. What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the incline on the block? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "25 N",
    "B": "35 N",
    "C": "43 N",
    "D": "50 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The free body diagram of the block shows two forces acting on it: the weight (mg) acting downwards and the normal force (N) perpendicular to the incline. The normal force can be found by resolving the weight vector into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline. The component perpendicular to the incline is given by mg cos θ, where θ is the angle of the incline with the horizontal. Thus, N = mg cos θ = (5 kg)(10 m/s^2)(cos 30°) ≈ 43 N."
