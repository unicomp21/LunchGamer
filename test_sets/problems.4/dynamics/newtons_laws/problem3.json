  "question": "A 2 kg block is pulled horizontally across a frictionless surface by a force of 10 N. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 m/s^2",
    "B": "5 m/s^2",
    "C": "10 m/s^2",
    "D": "20 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of an object is equal to the net force acting on it divided by its mass. In this case, the net force is the 10 N pulling force (since the surface is frictionless), and the mass is 2 kg. Using the formula a = F / m, we get: a = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
