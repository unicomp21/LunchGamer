  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed horizontally across a frictionless surface by a force of 10 N. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 m/s^2",
    "B": "5 m/s^2",
    "C": "10 m/s^2",
    "D": "20 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, a = F / m, where a is acceleration, F is the net force, and m is the mass of the object. In this case, F = 10 N and m = 2 kg. Substituting these values into the equation, we get: a = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 5 m/s^2."
