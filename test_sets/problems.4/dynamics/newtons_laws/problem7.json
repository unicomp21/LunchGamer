  "question": "A 2 kg block sits on a frictionless inclined plane angled at 30° to the horizontal. What is the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the plane on the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "9.8 N",
    "B": "10 N",
    "C": "17.3 N",
    "D": "19.6 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The normal force is perpendicular to the surface. Its magnitude can be found using Newton's Second Law and the force balance perpendicular to the incline. The forces perpendicular to the incline are the normal force N and the perpendicular component of the weight mg cos θ. Since the block is in equilibrium, the net force is zero.\n\nΣF_perpendicular = 0\nN - mg cos θ = 0\nN = mg cos θ\n\nGiven:\nm = 2 kg\ng = 9.8 m/s^2\nθ = 30°\n\nCalculate:\nN = (2 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(cos 30°)\nN = 19.6 cos 30°\nN = 17.0 N\n\nThe closest answer is C: 17.3 N."
