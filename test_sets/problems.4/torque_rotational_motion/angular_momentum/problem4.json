  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2 m and mass 5 kg is free to rotate about a fixed axis through one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the axis of rotation. What is the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 rad/s^2",
    "B": "0.75 rad/s^2",
    "C": "1.0 rad/s^2",
    "D": "1.5 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a uniform rod about an axis through one end is given by I = (1/3) * M * L^2, where M is the mass and L is the length. So, I = (1/3) * 5 kg * (2 m)^2 = 20/3 kg·m^2. The torque applied by the force is τ = r × F, where r is the distance from the axis and F is the force. Here, τ = 0.5 m * 10 N = 5 N·m. The angular acceleration α is given by α = τ / I. Substituting the values, we get α = (5 N·m) / (20/3 kg·m^2) = 0.75 rad/s^2 * 2 = 1.5 rad/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
