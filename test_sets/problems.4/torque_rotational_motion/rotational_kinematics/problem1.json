  "question": "A uniform solid disk of radius 0.5 m and mass 10 kg rotates about an axis through its center. If a constant tangential force of 20 N is applied to the edge of the disk, what is the angular acceleration of the disk?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 rad/s^2",
    "B": "4 rad/s^2",
    "C": "8 rad/s^2",
    "D": "16 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a solid disk is given by I = (1/2) * m * r^2, where m is the mass and r is the radius. Thus, I = (1/2) * 10 kg * (0.5 m)^2 = 1.25 kg*m^2. The torque τ is the product of the force F and the lever arm r, so τ = F * r = 20 N * 0.5 m = 10 N*m. The angular acceleration α is related to the torque and moment of inertia by τ = I * α. Solving for α, we get α = τ / I = (10 N*m) / (1.25 kg*m^2) = 8 rad/s^2."
