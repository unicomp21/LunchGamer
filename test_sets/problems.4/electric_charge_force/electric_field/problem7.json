  "question": "Two positive point charges, each with a charge of +Q, are separated by a distance r. If the distance between the charges is doubled, what happens to the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "The force increases by a factor of 2",
    "B": "The force increases by a factor of 4",
    "C": "The force decreases by a factor of 2",
    "D": "The force decreases by a factor of 4"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: F = k * |Q1| * |Q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. If the distance is doubled (r â†’ 2r), the force will decrease by a factor of (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, the force decreases by a factor of 4."
