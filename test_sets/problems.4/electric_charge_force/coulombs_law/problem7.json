  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +2 µC and q2 = -4 µC, are separated by a distance of 0.3 m. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the charges?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.0 × 10^-3 N",
    "B": "8.0 × 10^-3 N",
    "C": "1.2 × 10^-2 N",
    "D": "2.4 × 10^-2 N"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The electrostatic force between two point charges can be found using Coulomb's law: F = k × |q1| × |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. Substituting the values: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) × (2 × 10^-6 C) × (4 × 10^-6 C) / (0.3 m)^2 = 2.4 × 10^-2 N. The negative sign of q2 indicates attraction, but the question asks for the magnitude, so the answer is positive."
