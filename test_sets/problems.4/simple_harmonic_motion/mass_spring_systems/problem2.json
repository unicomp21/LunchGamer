  "question": "A 2.0 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.2 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the period of oscillation of the mass-spring system?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.40 s",
    "B": "0.63 s",
    "C": "1.26 s",
    "D": "1.59 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "For a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion, the period of oscillation T is given by the formula: T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nT = 2π√(2.0 kg / 50 N/m)\nT = 2π√(0.04 s^2)\nT = 2π(0.2 s)\nT ≈ 1.26 s\n\nTherefore, the period of oscillation for the mass-spring system is approximately 1.26 seconds, which corresponds to answer choice C."
