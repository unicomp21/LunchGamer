  "question": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the period of oscillation of the mass-spring system?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 s",
    "B": "0.4 s",
    "C": "0.8 s",
    "D": "1.6 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The period (T) of a mass-spring system can be found using the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. In this case, m = 2 kg and k = 50 N/m. Substituting these values into the formula:\n\nT = 2π√(2 kg / 50 N/m)\nT = 2π√(0.04 s^2)\nT = 2π(0.2 s)\nT ≈ 1.26 s\n\nThe closest answer choice is C, 0.8 s. While not exact, this is the best answer among the given choices, as none of them match the precise calculated value."
