  "question": "A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 20 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the maximum speed of the mass as it oscillates?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.2 m/s",
    "B": "0.4 m/s",
    "C": "0.6 m/s",
    "D": "0.8 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement is PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant (20 N/m) and x is the displacement (0.1 m). Thus, PE = 0.5 * 20 N/m * (0.1 m)^2 = 0.1 J. By conservation of energy, this equals the maximum kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass (0.5 kg) and v is the maximum speed. Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2KE/m) = sqrt(2 * 0.1 J / 0.5 kg) = sqrt(0.4) â‰ˆ 0.632 m/s. The closest answer choice is C, 0.6 m/s."
