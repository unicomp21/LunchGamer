  "question": "A simple pendulum has a length of 1.0 m and is released from an initial angle of 15° from the vertical. What is the approximate period of the pendulum? (Assume small angle approximation and g = 9.8 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.0 s",
    "B": "1.4 s",
    "C": "2.0 s",
    "D": "2.8 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "For a simple pendulum undergoing small oscillations, the period is given by the formula T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting the given values, we get:\nT = 2π√(1.0 m / 9.8 m/s^2)\nT ≈ 2.0 s\nTherefore, the approximate period of the pendulum is 2.0 s."
