  "question": "A 2.0 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. If the mass is displaced 0.10 m from its equilibrium position and released, what is the period of the resulting simple harmonic motion?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.13 s",
    "B": "0.40 s",
    "C": "1.3 s",
    "D": "4.0 s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values, we get: T = 2π√(2.0 kg / 50 N/m) = 2π√(0.040 s^2) = 2π(0.20 s) = 0.40 s. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
