  "question": "A mass attached to a spring oscillates with a period of 2 seconds. If the mass is doubled but the spring constant remains the same, what is the new period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 second",
    "B": "√2 seconds",
    "C": "2 seconds",
    "D": "2√2 seconds"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where T is the period, m is the mass, and k is the spring constant. If the mass is doubled (2m) and the spring constant remains the same, the new period will be T_new = 2π√(2m/k). This can be simplified to T_new = 2π√(2)√(m/k). Since the original period was T = 2π√(m/k) = 2 seconds, we can substitute this into the new period formula: T_new = 2√2 seconds."
