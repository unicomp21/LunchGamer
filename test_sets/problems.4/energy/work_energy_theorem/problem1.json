  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed 3 meters across a frictionless surface by a constant force of 5 N. How much work is done on the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 J",
    "B": "10 J",
    "C": "15 J",
    "D": "30 J"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The work done on the block can be calculated using the work-energy theorem: W = Fd, where F is the force applied (5 N) and d is the displacement of the block (3 m). Plugging in the values, we get W = 5 N Ã— 3 m = 15 J. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 15 J."
