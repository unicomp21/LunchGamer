  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed 5 meters along a frictionless horizontal surface by a constant force of 10 N. If the block starts from rest, what is its final kinetic energy?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "25 J",
    "B": "50 J",
    "C": "100 J",
    "D": "200 J"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Since the surface is frictionless, the only work done is by the constant force. The work done by the force is W = F × d = 10 N × 5 m = 50 J. As the block starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the final kinetic energy of the block is equal to the work done on it, which is 50 J."
