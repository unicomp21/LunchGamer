  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at a height of 10 m above the ground. What is the speed of the block just before it hits the ground? (Assume air resistance is negligible and g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "14 m/s",
    "D": "20 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy (PE) is converted to kinetic energy (KE) just before the block hits the ground. The initial PE is given by PE = mgh, where m is the mass (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2), and h is the initial height (10 m). Thus, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 10 m = 200 J. Just before hitting the ground, all of this energy is converted to KE, given by KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the block. Setting the initial PE equal to the final KE: 200 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2. Solving for v, we get: v = sqrt(200 J / (1 kg)) = sqrt(200 m^2/s^2) ≈ 14 m/s."
