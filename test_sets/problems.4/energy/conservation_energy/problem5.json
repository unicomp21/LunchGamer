  "question": "A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 5 meters. Neglecting air resistance, what is the speed of the ball just before it hits the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "7 m/s",
    "C": "10 m/s",
    "D": "14 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the conservation of energy principle, the initial potential energy (PE) is converted to kinetic energy (KE) just before hitting the ground. Initial PE = mgh = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 5 m = 100 J. Final KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed just before hitting the ground. Setting initial PE equal to final KE: 100 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2. Solving for v, we get: v = √(100 J / (1 kg)) = √(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s."
