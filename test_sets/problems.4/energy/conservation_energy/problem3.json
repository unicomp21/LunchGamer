  "question": "A 2 kg block starts from rest and slides down a frictionless ramp from a height of 5 m. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "7 m/s",
    "C": "10 m/s",
    "D": "14 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "By conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the block at the top of the ramp is converted entirely to kinetic energy at the bottom (since the ramp is frictionless). \nInitial potential energy: PE = mgh = (2 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(5 m) = 98 J\nFinal kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2 = 98 J\nSolve for final velocity v:\n98 J = (1/2)(2 kg)v^2\n98 J = (1 kg)v^2\nv^2 = 98 m^2/s^2\nv = sqrt(98 m^2/s^2) â‰ˆ 10 m/s\nTherefore, the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp is 10 m/s."
