  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless ramp that is 5 m high. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp? (Assume g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "100 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of energy, we can equate the initial potential energy of the block at the top of the ramp to its final kinetic energy at the bottom. Initially, the block has only potential energy: PE = mgh, where m is mass (2 kg), g is gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^2), and h is height (5 m). So, PE = 2 kg * 10 m/s^2 * 5 m = 100 J. At the bottom, the block has only kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed we're solving for. Setting the initial PE equal to the final KE: 100 J = (1/2) * 2 kg * v^2. Solving for v, we get: v = sqrt(100 J / (1 kg)) = sqrt(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 10 m/s."
