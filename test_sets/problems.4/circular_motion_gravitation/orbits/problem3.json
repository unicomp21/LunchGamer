  "question": "A satellite orbits a planet in a circular orbit. If the radius of the orbit is doubled, how does the orbital period change?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "The period is multiplied by √2",
    "B": "The period is multiplied by 2",
    "C": "The period is multiplied by 2√2",
    "D": "The period is multiplied by 4"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The orbital period T of a satellite in a circular orbit is given by Kepler's Third Law: T^2 = 4π^2r^3 / GM, where r is the orbital radius, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the planet. If the radius is doubled (r → 2r), then the new period T_new is related to the original period T by: T_new^2 = 4π^2(2r)^3 / GM = 8 * 4π^2r^3 / GM = 8T^2. Taking the square root of both sides, we get T_new = √8 * T = 2√2 * T. Therefore, doubling the orbital radius multiplies the orbital period by 2√2 (choice C)."
