  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. If the gravitational constant G is 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2 and the mass of Earth is 5.97 × 10^24 kg, what is the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.34 × 10^3 N",
    "B": "3.72 × 10^3 N",
    "C": "4.68 × 10^3 N",
    "D": "7.44 × 10^3 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force between the satellite and Earth. The magnitude of the gravitational force is given by F = GMm/r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of Earth, m is the mass of the satellite, and r is the radius of the orbit. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (5.97 × 10^24 kg) × (500 kg) / (8000 km)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11) × (5.97 × 10^24) × (500) / (8 × 10^6)^2\nF = 3.72 × 10^3 N\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force acting on the satellite is 3.72 × 10^3 N, which corresponds to choice B."
