  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally off a 50 m tall cliff with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Ignoring air resistance, how far from the base of the cliff will the ball land? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "50 m",
    "B": "60 m",
    "C": "63 m",
    "D": "100 m"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The ball's motion can be separated into horizontal and vertical components. Horizontally, the ball travels with constant velocity of 20 m/s. Vertically, it accelerates downward at 10 m/s^2 due to gravity. The time to fall 50 m can be found using y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at^2, where y0 = 50 m, v0 = 0, and a = -10 m/s^2. Solving, t = sqrt(2(50 m)/(10 m/s^2)) = sqrt(10 s^2) ≈ 3.16 s. In this time, the ball travels horizontally a distance of x = vt = (20 m/s)(3.16 s) ≈ 63 m. So the ball lands approximately 63 m from the base of the cliff."
