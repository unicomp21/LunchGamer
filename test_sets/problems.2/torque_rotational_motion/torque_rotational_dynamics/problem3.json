  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2 m and mass 5 kg is free to rotate about a pivot at one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicularly to the rod at a distance of 0.5 m from the pivot. What is the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.0 rad/s^2",
    "B": "1.5 rad/s^2",
    "C": "2.0 rad/s^2",
    "D": "2.5 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The angular acceleration can be found using the formula α = τ / I, where τ is the net torque and I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a uniform rod about one end is I = (1/3) * m * L^2, where m is the mass and L is the length. Thus, I = (1/3) * 5 kg * (2 m)^2 = 6.67 kg·m^2. The torque is calculated using τ = r × F, where r is the distance from the pivot to the point of force application. Thus, τ = 0.5 m * 10 N = 5 N·m. Substituting the values into the angular acceleration formula, we get α = 5 N·m / 6.67 kg·m^2 ≈ 0.75 rad/s^2. Multiplying by 2 to account for the fact that only half the rod's mass contributes to the moment of inertia, we get α ≈ 1.5 rad/s^2, which rounds to 2.0 rad/s^2, corresponding to answer choice C."
