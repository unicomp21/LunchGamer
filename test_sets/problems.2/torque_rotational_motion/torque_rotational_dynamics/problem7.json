  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2.0 m and mass 5.0 kg is free to rotate about an axis perpendicular to its length through one end. A force of 10 N is applied perpendicular to the rod at its midpoint. What is the magnitude of the angular acceleration of the rod?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.83 rad/s^2",
    "B": "1.7 rad/s^2",
    "C": "2.5 rad/s^2",
    "D": "5.0 rad/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The torque on the rod is given by τ = rF, where r is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force. In this case, r = 1.0 m (half the length of the rod) and F = 10 N, so τ = (1.0 m)(10 N) = 10 N·m.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a uniform rod about an axis through one end is I = (1/3)ML^2, where M is the mass and L is the length. Here, M = 5.0 kg and L = 2.0 m, so I = (1/3)(5.0 kg)(2.0 m)^2 = 6.7 kg·m^2.\n\nThe angular acceleration α is related to the torque τ and moment of inertia I by τ = Iα. Solving for α, we get α = τ / I = (10 N·m) / (6.7 kg·m^2) ≈ 1.7 rad/s^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
