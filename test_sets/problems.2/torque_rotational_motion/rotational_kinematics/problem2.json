  "question": "A uniform circular disk of radius 0.5 m and mass 10 kg rotates about an axis through its center. If the disk has an angular acceleration of 4 rad/s^2, what is the magnitude of the torque acting on the disk?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 N·m",
    "B": "5 N·m",
    "C": "10 N·m",
    "D": "20 N·m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a uniform circular disk about an axis through its center is given by I = (1/2) × m × r^2, where m is the mass and r is the radius. Plugging in the values, we get I = (1/2) × 10 kg × (0.5 m)^2 = 1.25 kg·m^2. The torque τ is related to the moment of inertia I and angular acceleration α by the equation τ = I × α. Substituting the values, we have τ = 1.25 kg·m^2 × 4 rad/s^2 = 5 N·m. Therefore, the magnitude of the torque acting on the disk is 5 N·m."
