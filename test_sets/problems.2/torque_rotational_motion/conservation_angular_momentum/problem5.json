  "question": "A figure skater with a moment of inertia of 2 kg·m² is spinning at 3 rad/s with her arms extended. When she pulls her arms in, her moment of inertia decreases to 1 kg·m². What is her new angular velocity?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.5 rad/s",
    "B": "3 rad/s",
    "C": "4.5 rad/s",
    "D": "6 rad/s"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "According to the conservation of angular momentum, the product of moment of inertia (I) and angular velocity (ω) remains constant when no external torque acts on the system. Thus, I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂, where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the initial and final states, respectively. Given that I₁ = 2 kg·m², ω₁ = 3 rad/s, and I₂ = 1 kg·m², we can solve for ω₂:\n\nI₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂\n2 kg·m² × 3 rad/s = 1 kg·m² × ω₂\n6 kg·m²·rad/s = 1 kg·m² × ω₂\nω₂ = 6 kg·m²·rad/s ÷ 1 kg·m² = 6 rad/s\n\nTherefore, when the figure skater pulls her arms in, her angular velocity increases to 6 rad/s."
