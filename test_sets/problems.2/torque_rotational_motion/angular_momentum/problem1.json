  "question": "A uniform rod of length 2.0 m and mass 5.0 kg rotates about an axis perpendicular to its length at one end. If the rod has an angular velocity of 4.0 rad/s, what is its angular momentum?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.7 kg·m^2/s",
    "B": "10 kg·m^2/s",
    "C": "13 kg·m^2/s",
    "D": "20 kg·m^2/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The moment of inertia of a uniform rod rotating about an axis at one end is I = (1/3)ML^2, where M is the mass and L is the length. So, I = (1/3) × 5.0 kg × (2.0 m)^2 = 6.7 kg·m^2. Angular momentum is defined as L = Iω, where ω is the angular velocity. Plugging in the values, we get L = 6.7 kg·m^2 × 4.0 rad/s ≈ 13 kg·m^2/s (rounded to two significant figures). Therefore, the correct answer is C."
