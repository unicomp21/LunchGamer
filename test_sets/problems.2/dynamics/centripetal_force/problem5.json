  "question": "A 1.0 kg object is attached to a string and revolves in a horizontal circle with a radius of 0.5 m. If the object makes one complete revolution every 0.8 seconds, what is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.2 N",
    "B": "2.5 N",
    "C": "4.9 N",
    "D": "9.8 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "To find the tension, we use the centripetal force formula: F_c = mv^2/r, where m is the mass, v is the tangential velocity, and r is the radius. We can find the velocity using v = 2πr/T, where T is the period.\n\nFirst, calculate the velocity:\nv = 2π(0.5 m)/(0.8 s) ≈ 3.9 m/s\n\nNow, use the centripetal force formula:\nF_c = (1.0 kg)(3.9 m/s)^2/(0.5 m) ≈ 30.8 kg⋅m/s^2 = 30.8 N\n\nThe tension in the string is equal to the centripetal force, so the tension is approximately 30.8 N. The closest answer choice is C, 4.9 N."
