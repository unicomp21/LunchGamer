  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed across a frictionless horizontal surface by a constant force of 10 N. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 m/s^2",
    "B": "4 m/s^2",
    "C": "5 m/s^2",
    "D": "20 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of an object is equal to the net force acting on it divided by its mass. In this case, the net force is the 10 N pushing force, since the surface is frictionless. Using the formula a = F / m, we get: a = 10 N / 2 kg = 5 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
