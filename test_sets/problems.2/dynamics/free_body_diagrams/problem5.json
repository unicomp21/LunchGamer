  "question": "A block of mass 5 kg is pulled along a horizontal frictionless surface by a force of 20 N at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. What is the acceleration of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.0 m/s^2",
    "B": "3.0 m/s^2",
    "C": "3.5 m/s^2",
    "D": "4.0 m/s^2"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "To find the acceleration, we need to determine the net force acting on the block in the horizontal direction. The free body diagram shows the applied force (20 N) and its horizontal and vertical components. The vertical component balances the normal force, while the horizontal component is the net force.\n\nHorizontal component of the applied force: F_x = 20 cos(30°) ≈ 17.3 N\n\nUsing Newton's Second Law, F_net = ma, we can find the acceleration:\n\n17.3 N = 5 kg × a\na = 17.3 N ÷ 5 kg ≈ 3.5 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the block is approximately 3.5 m/s^2."
