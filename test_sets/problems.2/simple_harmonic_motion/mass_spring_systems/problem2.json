  "question": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. If the mass is displaced 10 cm from its equilibrium position and released, what is the period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.40 s",
    "B": "0.63 s",
    "C": "1.26 s",
    "D": "2.00 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system can be found using the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the given values: T = 2π√(2 kg / 50 N/m) = 2π√(0.04 s^2) = 2π(0.2 s) = 1.26 s. The initial displacement and release conditions do not affect the period. Thus, the correct answer is C: 1.26 s."
