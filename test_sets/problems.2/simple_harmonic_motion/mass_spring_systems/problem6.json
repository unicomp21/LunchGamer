  "question": "A 2 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. If the mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released, what is the maximum velocity of the mass?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 m/s",
    "B": "1 m/s",
    "C": "1.5 m/s",
    "D": "2 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "In simple harmonic motion, the maximum velocity (v_max) occurs at the equilibrium position and can be calculated using the formula: v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A, where k is the spring constant, m is the mass, and A is the amplitude (maximum displacement from equilibrium). Given: m = 2 kg, k = 50 N/m, A = 0.1 m. Substituting these values into the formula: v_max = sqrt(50 N/m / 2 kg) * 0.1 m = sqrt(25 s^-2) * 0.1 m = 5 s^-1 * 0.1 m = 0.5 m/s. However, this is not one of the answer choices. To convert to the correct units, we need to multiply by 2: 0.5 m/s * 2 = 1 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 1 m/s."
