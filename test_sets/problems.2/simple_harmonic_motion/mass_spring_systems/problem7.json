  "question": "A 2.0 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. If the mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released, what is the period of the resulting simple harmonic motion?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.13 s",
    "B": "0.40 s",
    "C": "1.3 s",
    "D": "4.0 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The period T of a mass-spring system undergoing simple harmonic motion is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Substituting the given values, we have:\n\nT = 2π√(2.0 kg / 50 N/m)\n  = 2π√(0.04 s^2)\n  = 2π(0.2 s)\n  = 1.26 s ≈ 1.3 s\n\nTherefore, the period of oscillation is closest to 1.3 s, corresponding to answer choice C."
