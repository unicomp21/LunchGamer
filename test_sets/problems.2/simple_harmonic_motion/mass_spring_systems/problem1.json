  "question": "A 2.0 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released. What is the maximum speed of the mass as it oscillates?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.25 m/s",
    "B": "0.50 m/s",
    "C": "1.0 m/s",
    "D": "2.0 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position, where all the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy at maximum displacement is given by PE = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement. Thus, PE = (1/2)(50 N/m)(0.1 m)^2 = 0.25 J. By conservation of energy, this equals the maximum kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the maximum speed. Solving for v, we get: 0.25 J = (1/2)(2.0 kg)v^2, which gives v = 0.50 m/s."
