  "question": "A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 20 N/m. If the mass is displaced 0.1 m from its equilibrium position and released, what is the period of the resulting oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.14 s",
    "B": "0.31 s",
    "C": "0.63 s",
    "D": "1.26 s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The period of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by the formula T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. Plugging in the values, we get T = 2π√(0.5 kg / 20 N/m) = 2π√(0.025 s^2) ≈ 0.31 s. Therefore, the period of oscillation is closest to 0.31 s, which corresponds to answer choice B."
