  "question": "A mass on a spring oscillates with a period of 2 seconds. If the mass is doubled while the spring constant remains unchanged, what is the new period of oscillation?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 second",
    "B": "√2 seconds",
    "C": "2 seconds",
    "D": "2√2 seconds"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The period of a mass-spring system is given by T = 2π√(m/k), where m is the mass and k is the spring constant. If the mass is doubled (2m) and the spring constant remains the same, the new period will be T_new = 2π√(2m/k). This can be simplified to T_new = 2π√(2/k)√m = √2 * 2π√(m/k) = √2 * T_original. Since the original period was 2 seconds, the new period will be 2√2 seconds, which corresponds to answer choice D."
