  "question": "A mass oscillating on a spring has a period of 2 seconds and an amplitude of 0.5 meters. What is the maximum speed of the mass?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.25π m/s",
    "B": "0.5π m/s",
    "C": "π m/s",
    "D": "2π m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "For simple harmonic motion, the maximum speed occurs at the equilibrium position and can be calculated using v_max = A × ω, where A is the amplitude and ω is the angular frequency. The angular frequency ω is related to the period T by ω = 2π / T. Given the period of 2 seconds and the amplitude of 0.5 meters, we can calculate the maximum speed:\n\nω = 2π / T = 2π / 2 = π rad/s\nv_max = A × ω = 0.5 m × π rad/s = 0.5π m/s\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 0.5π m/s."
