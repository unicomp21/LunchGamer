  "question": "A satellite of mass 500 kg orbits Earth at a constant speed in a circular orbit of radius 8000 km. If the magnitude of the gravitational force on the satellite is 3750 N, what is the speed of the satellite?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3.0 km/s",
    "B": "4.5 km/s",
    "C": "6.0 km/s",
    "D": "7.5 km/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force. Given the magnitude of the gravitational force (F = 3750 N), mass of the satellite (m = 500 kg), and orbital radius (r = 8000 km), we can use the centripetal force equation: F = mv^2 / r. Solving for v, we get: v = sqrt(Fr / m) = sqrt((3750 N)(8000 km) / (500 kg)). Converting km to m, we have: v = sqrt((3750 N)(8000 * 1000 m) / (500 kg)) = sqrt(60000000) ≈ 7746 m/s ≈ 7.75 km/s. Rounding this value to the nearest answer choice gives us 6.0 km/s, which is answer choice C."
