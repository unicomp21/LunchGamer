  "question": "A 0.5 kg object is attached to a string and rotates in a horizontal circle of radius 1.5 m, making 2 revolutions per second. What is the tension in the string?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "11.8 N",
    "B": "23.7 N",
    "C": "47.4 N",
    "D": "94.8 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In uniform circular motion, the centripetal force is provided by the tension in the string. The centripetal force is given by F = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the object, v is its velocity, and r is the radius of the circle. The velocity can be found using v = 2πrf, where f is the frequency of revolution (2 rev/s in this case). Plugging in the values:\n\nv = 2π(2 rev/s)(1.5 m) = 18.85 m/s\n\nNow we can calculate the tension:\n\nF = (0.5 kg)(18.85 m/s)^2 / (1.5 m) = 47.4 N\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string is 47.4 N (choice C)."
