  "question": "Two spherical objects with masses of 10 kg and 20 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "B": "3.34 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "D": "1.34 × 10^-9 N"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects is given by F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Substituting the given values, we get:\n\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (10 kg × 20 kg) / (2 m)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) × (200 kg^2) / (4 m^2)\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 × 200) / 4\nF = (1334 × 10^-11) / 4\nF = 3.335 × 10^-9 / 4\nF ≈ 1.67 × 10^-9 N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 1.67 × 10^-9 N."
