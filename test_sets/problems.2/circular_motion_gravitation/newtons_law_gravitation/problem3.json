  "question": "Two spherical objects with masses of 10 kg and 40 kg are separated by a distance of 2 meters. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3.34 × 10^-10 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "1.34 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "2.67 × 10^-9 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force (F) between two objects with masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r, is given by the formula: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2). Substituting the given values: m1 = 10 kg, m2 = 40 kg, r = 2 m, we get: F = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 40 kg) / (2 m)^2 = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × 400 kg^2 / 4 m^2 = (6.67 × 400 / 4) × 10^-11 N = 6.67 × 10^-10 N. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1.34 × 10^-9 N, which is equal to 2 × (6.67 × 10^-10 N)."
