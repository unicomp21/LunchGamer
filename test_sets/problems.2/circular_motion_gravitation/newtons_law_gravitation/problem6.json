  "question": "Two spherical objects, each with a mass of 10 kg, are separated by a distance of 1 meter. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.67 × 10^-11 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "C": "6.67 × 10^-9 N",
    "D": "6.67 × 10^-8 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force F between two objects with masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r, is given by the formula F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2). In this problem, m1 = m2 = 10 kg, and r = 1 m. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: F = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 10 kg) / (1 m)^2 = 6.67 × 10^-10 N. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
