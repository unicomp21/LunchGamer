  "question": "Two spherical objects, each of mass 10 kg, are placed such that their centers are 1 meter apart. What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between them? (Gravitational constant G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m^2/kg^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6.67 × 10^-12 N",
    "B": "6.67 × 10^-11 N",
    "C": "6.67 × 10^-10 N",
    "D": "6.67 × 10^-9 N"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to Newton's law of gravitation, the magnitude of the gravitational force F between two objects with masses m1 and m2, separated by a distance r, is given by the formula F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant. Substituting the given values: m1 = m2 = 10 kg, r = 1 m, and G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m^2/kg^2, we get:\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N·m^2/kg^2) × (10 kg × 10 kg) / (1 m)^2\nF = (6.67 × 10^-11 N·m^2/kg^2) × (100 kg^2) / (1 m^2)\nF = 6.67 × 10^-11 N\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
