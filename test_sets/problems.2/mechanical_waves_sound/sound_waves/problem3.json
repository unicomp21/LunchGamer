  "question": "A sound wave travels through air with a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m. What is the speed of the sound wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "170 m/s",
    "B": "250 m/s",
    "C": "340 m/s",
    "D": "440 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = fλ, where v is the speed of the wave, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Substituting the given values, we get: v = 500 Hz × 0.68 m = 340 m/s. Therefore, the speed of the sound wave is 340 m/s."
