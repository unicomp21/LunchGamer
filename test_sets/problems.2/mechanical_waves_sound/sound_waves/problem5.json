  "question": "A sound wave with a frequency of 500 Hz is traveling through air with a speed of 340 m/s. What is the wavelength of the sound wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.17 m",
    "B": "0.68 m",
    "C": "1.7 m",
    "D": "6.8 m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The wavelength of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the speed of the wave, f is the frequency, and 位 is the wavelength. Rearranging the equation to solve for wavelength, we get: 位 = v / f. Substituting the given values, we have: 位 = 340 m/s / 500 Hz = 0.68 m. Therefore, the wavelength of the sound wave is 0.68 m."
