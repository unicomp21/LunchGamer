  "question": "A sound wave with a frequency of 500 Hz travels through air at sea level, where the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s. What is the wavelength of this sound wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.343 m",
    "B": "0.686 m",
    "C": "1.46 m",
    "D": "171.5 m"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The wavelength of a wave can be calculated using the wave equation: v = f位, where v is the speed of the wave, f is the frequency, and 位 is the wavelength. Rearranging this equation to solve for wavelength gives: 位 = v / f. Plugging in the given values: 位 = 343 m/s / 500 Hz = 0.686 m. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
