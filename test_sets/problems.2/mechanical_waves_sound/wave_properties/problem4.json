  "question": "A transverse wave is traveling along a string with a frequency of 50 Hz and a wavelength of 0.4 m. What is the speed of the wave?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "10 m/s",
    "B": "20 m/s",
    "C": "30 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "The speed of a wave can be calculated using the wave speed equation: v = fλ, where v is the wave speed, f is the frequency, and λ is the wavelength. Substituting the given values, we have: v = 50 Hz × 0.4 m = 20 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is B, 20 m/s."
