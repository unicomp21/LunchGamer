  "question": "A stationary observer hears a siren from an ambulance approaching at a constant velocity. Compared to the actual frequency of the siren, the frequency heard by the observer is:",
  "choices": {
    "A": "higher than the actual frequency",
    "B": "lower than the actual frequency",
    "C": "equal to the actual frequency",
    "D": "impossible to determine without more information"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "The Doppler effect describes the change in frequency of a wave perceived by an observer when the source of the wave is moving relative to the observer. In this case, the ambulance (source) is moving towards the stationary observer. As the ambulance approaches, each successive wave crest is emitted from a position closer to the observer than the previous wave crest. Therefore, the distance between the crests decreases, and the observer perceives a higher frequency compared to the actual frequency of the siren. This is known as the Doppler shift. The observed frequency f' is related to the actual frequency f by the equation f' = f * (v + v_o) / (v + v_s), where v is the speed of sound, v_o is the speed of the observer (zero in this case), and v_s is the speed of the source (ambulance) relative to the medium."
