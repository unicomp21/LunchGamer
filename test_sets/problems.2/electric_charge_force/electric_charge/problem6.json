  "question": "Two small charged spheres are separated by a distance of 0.5 meters. If the magnitude of the electric force between them is 0.02 N and the charge on one sphere is 3 × 10^-6 C, what is the charge on the other sphere?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 × 10^-6 C",
    "B": "2 × 10^-6 C",
    "C": "4 × 10^-6 C",
    "D": "6 × 10^-6 C"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The electric force between two charged objects can be calculated using Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges on the objects, and r is the distance between them. Rearranging the equation to solve for q2, we get: |q2| = F * r^2 / (k * |q1|). Plugging in the given values: |q2| = 0.02 N * (0.5 m)^2 / (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2 * 3 × 10^-6 C) ≈ 6 × 10^-6 C. Therefore, the charge on the other sphere is 6 × 10^-6 C."
