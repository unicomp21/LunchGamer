  "question": "Two point charges, +2 μC and -4 μC, are separated by a distance of 0.5 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.44 × 10^-3 N",
    "B": "2.88 × 10^-3 N",
    "C": "5.76 × 10^-3 N",
    "D": "1.15 × 10^-2 N"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law: F = k × |q1| × |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Substituting the values: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2) × (2 × 10^-6 C) × (4 × 10^-6 C) / (0.5 m)^2. Simplifying: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N·m^2/C^2) × (8 × 10^-12 C^2) / (0.25 m^2) = 2.88 × 10^-4 N·m^2 / 0.25 m^2 = 1.15 × 10^-3 N/m^2 × m^2 = 1.15 × 10^-2 N. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric force between the charges is 1.15 × 10^-2 N."
