  "question": "Two positive point charges, each with a charge of q, are separated by a distance r. If the distance between the charges is doubled while keeping the charges the same, what happens to the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "The force is doubled",
    "B": "The force is halved",
    "C": "The force is reduced to one-fourth of the original value",
    "D": "The force remains the same"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: F = k * (q1 * q2) / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges. In this case, both charges are equal to q, so the force is F = k * (q^2) / r^2. When the distance is doubled, r becomes 2r, so the new force is F_new = k * (q^2) / (2r)^2 = k * (q^2) / 4r^2 = (1/4) * (k * (q^2) / r^2) = (1/4) * F. Therefore, the force is reduced to one-fourth of its original value when the distance is doubled."
