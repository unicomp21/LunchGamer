  "question": "Two positive point charges, each with a charge of +Q, are separated by a distance r. If the distance between the charges is doubled, what happens to the magnitude of the electric force between them?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "The force becomes 2 times larger",
    "B": "The force becomes 4 times larger",
    "C": "The force becomes 1/2 times as large",
    "D": "The force becomes 1/4 times as large"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: F = k * |Q1| * |Q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. If the distance is doubled (r becomes 2r), the force will be: F_new = k * |Q| * |Q| / (2r)^2 = k * |Q|^2 / 4r^2 = (1/4) * (k * |Q|^2 / r^2) = (1/4) * F_initial. Therefore, the force becomes 1/4 times as large when the distance is doubled."
