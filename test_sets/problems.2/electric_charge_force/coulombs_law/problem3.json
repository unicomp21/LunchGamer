  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = 2 μC and q2 = -6 μC, are separated by a distance of 0.3 m. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between them? (k = 9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "6 × 10^-3 N",
    "B": "1.2 × 10^-1 N",
    "C": "4 × 10^2 N",
    "D": "1.2 × 10^2 N"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law: F = k|q1q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges (2 × 10^-6 C and -6 × 10^-6 C), and r is the distance between the charges (0.3 m). Substituting the values, we get: F = (9 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) × |(2 × 10^-6 C) × (-6 × 10^-6 C)| / (0.3 m)^2 = 1.2 × 10^2 N. The negative sign of q2 does not affect the magnitude of the force."
