  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +3 nC and q2 = -6 nC, are separated by a distance of 2 m. What is the magnitude of the electric force between the charges?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.0 × 10^-6 N",
    "B": "4.0 × 10^-6 N",
    "C": "1.4 × 10^-5 N",
    "D": "2.7 × 10^-5 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges can be found using Coulomb's law: F = k|q1||q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Substituting the given values, we get: F = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) × (3 × 10^-9 C) × (6 × 10^-9 C) / (2 m)^2 = 1.35 × 10^-5 N ≈ 1.4 × 10^-5 N. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
