  "question": "Two point charges, q1 = +2 μC and q2 = -4 μC, are separated by a distance of 0.5 m. What is the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the charges?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "7.2 × 10^-3 N",
    "B": "5.8 × 10^-2 N",
    "C": "1.4 × 10^-2 N",
    "D": "2.9 × 10^-2 N"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The electrostatic force between two point charges can be found using Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1| * |q2| / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Substituting the given values, we get:\nF = (8.99 × 10^9 N⋅m^2/C^2) * (2 × 10^-6 C) * (4 × 10^-6 C) / (0.5 m)^2\nF = (8.99 × 10^9) * (8 × 10^-12) / 0.25\nF = 0.014391 N ≈ 1.4 × 10^-2 N\nTherefore, the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the charges is approximately 1.4 × 10^-2 N."
