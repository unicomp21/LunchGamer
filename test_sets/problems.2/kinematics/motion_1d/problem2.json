  "question": "A ball is thrown straight up with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. Assuming air resistance is negligible, how long does it take for the ball to reach its maximum height? (Take the acceleration due to gravity as -9.8 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.02 s",
    "B": "2.04 s",
    "C": "4.08 s",
    "D": "10.2 s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "To find the time taken for the ball to reach its maximum height, we can use the equation v_f = v_i + at, where v_f is the final velocity (0 m/s at the maximum height), v_i is the initial velocity (20 m/s), a is the acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/s^2), and t is the time taken. Rearranging the equation, we get: t = (v_f - v_i) / a = (0 - 20) / -9.8 â‰ˆ 2.04 s. Therefore, the ball takes approximately 2.04 seconds to reach its maximum height."
