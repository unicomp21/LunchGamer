  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a 45 meter tall building with an initial speed of 20 m/s. Neglecting air resistance, approximately how far from the base of the building will the ball land? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "30 m",
    "B": "45 m",
    "C": "60 m",
    "D": "90 m"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The horizontal and vertical motions can be analyzed independently. In the horizontal direction, the velocity is constant at 20 m/s. The time of flight can be found by analyzing the vertical motion: y = y0 + v0y*t + (1/2)*a*t^2, where y0 = 45 m, v0y = 0 m/s (since the ball is thrown horizontally), and a = -10 m/s^2. Setting y = 0 (ground level), we get: 0 = 45 + 0*t - 5*t^2. Solving this quadratic equation yields t â‰ˆ 3 s. The horizontal distance traveled is then x = v*t = 20 m/s * 3 s = 60 m."
