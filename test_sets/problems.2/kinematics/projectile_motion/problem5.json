  "question": "A ball is thrown horizontally off a cliff with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. The cliff is 80 m above the ground below. Approximately how long does it take for the ball to reach the ground? (Assume negligible air resistance and use g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 s",
    "B": "3 s",
    "C": "4 s",
    "D": "5 s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In projectile motion, the horizontal and vertical components of motion are independent. The time to reach the ground depends only on the vertical motion, which starts with zero vertical velocity. Using the equation y = y0 + v0y*t + (1/2)*a*t^2, with y0 = 80 m, v0y = 0 m/s, a = -10 m/s^2 (negative because gravity acts downward), and y = 0 m (ground level), we get: 0 = 80 + 0*t + (1/2)*(-10)*t^2. Simplifying: 0 = 80 - 5*t^2, or 5*t^2 = 80. Solving for t, we get t^2 = 16, so t = 4 s. Therefore, the ball takes approximately 4 seconds to reach the ground."
