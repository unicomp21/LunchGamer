  "question": "Two identical parallel-plate capacitors are connected in series to a battery. If the plate separation in one of the capacitors is doubled while the other remains unchanged, what happens to the total capacitance of the system?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "It decreases to 1/4 of the original value",
    "B": "It decreases to 1/3 of the original value",
    "C": "It decreases to 1/2 of the original value",
    "D": "It increases to 4/3 of the original value"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "For parallel-plate capacitors, capacitance C = εA/d, where ε is the permittivity, A is the plate area, and d is the plate separation. When capacitors are in series, the total capacitance is given by 1/C_total = 1/C1 + 1/C2. Initially, C1 = C2, so C_total = C1/2. When the plate separation of one capacitor is doubled, its capacitance becomes C1/2. The new total capacitance is 1/C_total_new = 1/(C1/2) + 1/C1 = 3/(2C1). The ratio of new to original total capacitance is (C1/2)/(2C1/3) = 1/3. Therefore, the total capacitance decreases to 1/3 of its original value."
