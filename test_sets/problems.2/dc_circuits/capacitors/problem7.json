  "question": "Two capacitors with capacitances C1 = 2 μF and C2 = 3 μF are connected in series to a 12 V battery. What is the voltage across the 2 μF capacitor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "3 V",
    "B": "4.8 V",
    "C": "7.2 V",
    "D": "9 V"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "For capacitors in series, the total capacitance Ctotal is given by 1/Ctotal = 1/C1 + 1/C2. Here, 1/Ctotal = 1/(2 μF) + 1/(3 μF) = 5/(6 μF), so Ctotal = 6/5 μF. The voltage across each capacitor is proportional to the total voltage divided by the capacitance ratio. For the 2 μF capacitor, VC1 = (C2 / Ctotal) * Vtotal = (3 μF / (6/5 μF)) * 12 V = 3/5 * 12 V = 7.2 V."
