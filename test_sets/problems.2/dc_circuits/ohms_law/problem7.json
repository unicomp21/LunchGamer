  "question": "A 12 V battery is connected to a resistor with a resistance of 6 Ω. What is the current flowing through the resistor?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "0.5 A",
    "B": "1 A",
    "C": "2 A",
    "D": "4 A"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Ohm's law, the current (I) through a resistor is equal to the voltage (V) across the resistor divided by the resistance (R) of the resistor. Mathematically, this is expressed as I = V / R. In this case, the voltage is 12 V and the resistance is 6 Ω. Thus, the current can be calculated as I = 12 V / 6 Ω = 2 A. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 2 A."
