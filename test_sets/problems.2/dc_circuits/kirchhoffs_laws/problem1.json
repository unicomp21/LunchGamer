  "question": "In the circuit shown, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is 3 A. What is the voltage of the power supply?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 V",
    "B": "4 V",
    "C": "6 V",
    "D": "12 V"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "Using Kirchhoff's current law, the current through the 1 Ω resistor is also 3 A, since the resistors are in series. Applying Ohm's law to each resistor, the voltage across the 1 Ω resistor is V1 = IR1 = (3 A)(1 Ω) = 3 V, and the voltage across the 2 Ω resistor is V2 = IR2 = (3 A)(2 Ω) = 6 V. By Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage of the power supply is the sum of the voltages across the resistors: VS = V1 + V2 = 3 V + 6 V = 12 V."
