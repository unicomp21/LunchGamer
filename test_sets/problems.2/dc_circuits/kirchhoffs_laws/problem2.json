  "question": "In the circuit shown, the current through the 2 Ω resistor is 2 A. What is the value of the battery voltage?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2 V",
    "B": "4 V",
    "C": "6 V",
    "D": "8 V"
  },
  "answer": "D",
  "solution": "According to Kirchhoff's second law, the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop in a circuit must equal the sum of the voltage sources. In this case, the voltage drop across the 2 Ω resistor is V = IR = 2 A × 2 Ω = 4 V. The voltage drop across the 2 Ω resistor and the battery voltage form a closed loop, so they must be equal. Therefore, the battery voltage must be 8 V."
