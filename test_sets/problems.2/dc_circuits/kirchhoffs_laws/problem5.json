  "question": "In the circuit shown, all resistors have equal resistance R. What is the equivalent resistance between points X and Y?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "R/3",
    "B": "R/2",
    "C": "2R/3",
    "D": "3R/4"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "According to Kirchhoff's current law, the current flowing into a node must equal the current flowing out. In this case, the current splits equally between the two parallel branches. Each branch contains two resistors in series, so the resistance of each branch is 2R. The equivalent resistance of two equal parallel resistors is given by the formula 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2. Substituting R_1 = R_2 = 2R, we get 1/R_eq = 1/(2R) + 1/(2R) = 2/(2R). Solving for R_eq, we find R_eq = 2R/2 = R. Finally, this equivalent resistance is in series with the third resistor, so the total resistance between X and Y is R_eq + R = R + R/2 = 3R/2. Therefore, the equivalent resistance is 2R/3."
