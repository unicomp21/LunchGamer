  "question": "A 2 kg ball traveling at 5 m/s to the right collides head-on with a 3 kg ball that is initially at rest. If the collision is perfectly elastic, what is the velocity of the 2 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.0 m/s to the left",
    "B": "1.0 m/s to the right",
    "C": "2.0 m/s to the left",
    "D": "2.0 m/s to the right"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let v1 and v2 be the velocities of the 2 kg and 3 kg balls after the collision, respectively. From conservation of momentum: 2 kg * 5 m/s = 2 kg * v1 + 3 kg * v2. From conservation of kinetic energy: (1/2) * 2 kg * (5 m/s)^2 = (1/2) * 2 kg * v1^2 + (1/2) * 3 kg * v2^2. Solving these equations simultaneously yields v1 = -2 m/s and v2 = 3 m/s. The negative sign for v1 indicates that the 2 kg ball bounces back to the left at 2 m/s after the collision."
