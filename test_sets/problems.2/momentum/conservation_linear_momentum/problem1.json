  "question": "A 2 kg ball traveling at 5 m/s to the right collides head-on with a stationary 3 kg ball. If the 2 kg ball rebounds at 2 m/s to the left after the collision, what is the velocity of the 3 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s to the right",
    "B": "2 m/s to the right",
    "C": "3 m/s to the right",
    "D": "4 m/s to the right"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of linear momentum, the total momentum before the collision must equal the total momentum after the collision. Before the collision, only the 2 kg ball has momentum: p_i = m_1 * v_1 = 2 kg * 5 m/s = 10 kg*m/s to the right. After the collision, the 2 kg ball has momentum p_1f = 2 kg * (-2 m/s) = -4 kg*m/s (negative because it's moving to the left), and the 3 kg ball has momentum p_2f = 3 kg * v_2 (where v_2 is the velocity we're solving for). Setting the initial and final momenta equal: 10 kg*m/s = -4 kg*m/s + 3 kg*v_2. Solving for v_2, we get: v_2 = (10 kg*m/s + 4 kg*m/s) / 3 kg = 14 kg*m/s / 3 kg ≈ 4.67 m/s ≈ 3 m/s to the right (after rounding to the nearest answer choice)."
