  "question": "Two carts, A and B, with masses of 2 kg and 3 kg respectively, move towards each other on a frictionless track. Cart A has an initial velocity of 4 m/s to the right, while Cart B has an initial velocity of 2 m/s to the left. After the collision, Cart A moves to the left with a velocity of 1 m/s. What is the velocity of Cart B after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1 m/s to the right",
    "B": "2 m/s to the right",
    "C": "3 m/s to the right",
    "D": "4 m/s to the right"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of momentum, we can write: m_A * v_A1 + m_B * v_B1 = m_A * v_A2 + m_B * v_B2, where v_A1 and v_B1 are the initial velocities, and v_A2 and v_B2 are the final velocities. Substituting the given values, we get: 2 * 4 + 3 * (-2) = 2 * (-1) + 3 * v_B2. Simplifying, 8 - 6 = -2 + 3 * v_B2, which gives us 3 * v_B2 = 4. Therefore, v_B2 = 4 / 3 = 1.33 m/s. Since the question asks for the nearest integer velocity, the correct answer is 1 m/s to the right, which is choice C."
