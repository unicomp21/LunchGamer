  "question": "A 2 kg ball moving at 5 m/s collides head-on with a stationary 3 kg ball. If the collision is perfectly elastic, what is the speed of the 3 kg ball after the collision?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "1.0 m/s",
    "B": "2.0 m/s",
    "C": "3.0 m/s",
    "D": "4.0 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "In a perfectly elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Let v1 and v2 be the final velocities of the 2 kg and 3 kg balls, respectively. From conservation of momentum: 2(5) + 3(0) = 2(v1) + 3(v2). This simplifies to 10 = 2v1 + 3v2. From conservation of kinetic energy: (1/2)2(5^2) = (1/2)2(v1^2) + (1/2)3(v2^2). This simplifies to 25 = v1^2 + (3/2)v2^2. Solving these equations simultaneously yields v2 = 2 m/s, so the 3 kg ball will have a speed of 2 m/s after the collision."
