  "question": "A 2 kg ball is rolling at a speed of 5 m/s when it is struck by a bat, exerting an average force of 100 N on the ball for 0.05 seconds. What is the final speed of the ball after being struck?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "2.5 m/s",
    "B": "5.0 m/s",
    "C": "7.5 m/s",
    "D": "10.0 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The impulse-momentum theorem states that the change in momentum of an object is equal to the impulse applied to it. Impulse (J) is defined as the product of the average force (F) and the time interval (Δt) over which the force acts: J = FΔt. The change in momentum (Δp) is equal to the change in velocity (Δv) multiplied by the mass (m) of the object: Δp = mΔv. Setting these equal, we have: FΔt = mΔv. Rearranging to solve for Δv: Δv = FΔt / m. Substituting the given values: Δv = (100 N)(0.05 s) / (2 kg) = 2.5 m/s. Since the initial velocity was 5 m/s, the final velocity will be the sum of the initial velocity and the change in velocity: v_f = v_i + Δv = 5 m/s + 2.5 m/s = 7.5 m/s. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
