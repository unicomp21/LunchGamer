  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed along a horizontal frictionless surface by a constant force of 10 N. If the block starts from rest and the force is applied for 5 meters, what is the final kinetic energy of the block?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "25 J",
    "B": "50 J",
    "C": "100 J",
    "D": "200 J"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "According to the work-energy theorem, the net work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the work done by the constant force is W = F × d, where F is the force (10 N) and d is the distance (5 m). Thus, W = 10 N × 5 m = 50 J. Since the block starts from rest (initial kinetic energy is 0) and the surface is frictionless (no energy dissipation), the final kinetic energy of the block is equal to the work done, which is 50 J."
