  "question": "A 2 kg block starts from rest at the top of a 5 m tall frictionless ramp inclined at 30 degrees. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "7 m/s",
    "C": "10 m/s",
    "D": "12 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "A",
  "solution": "Using the work-energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy equals the net work done on the block. The initial kinetic energy is zero since the block starts from rest. The work done by gravity is the only non-zero work. It is calculated as: W = mgΔh, where m is mass (2 kg), g is gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^2), and Δh is the vertical height change (5 m × sin(30°) = 2.5 m). Putting this together:\n\n0.5 × m × v^2 = mgΔh\n0.5 × 2 kg × v^2 = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 2.5 m\nv^2 = 100 m^2/s^2\nv = 10 m/s\nv = 5 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp is 5 m/s."
