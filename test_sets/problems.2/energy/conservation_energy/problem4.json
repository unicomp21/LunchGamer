  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless ramp that is 5 m long and inclined at an angle of 30° above the horizontal. What is the speed of the block at the bottom of the ramp? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "5√2 m/s",
    "D": "10√3 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "By the conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the block is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp. The initial potential energy is PE = mgh, where m is the mass (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (10 m/s^2), and h is the vertical height of the ramp. The height can be found using trigonometry: h = 5 sin(30°) = 2.5 m. Thus, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 2.5 m = 50 J. At the bottom of the ramp, this energy is converted into kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the block. Setting PE equal to KE and solving for v: 50 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2, which gives v^2 = 50 m^2/s^2, or v = 5√2 m/s."
