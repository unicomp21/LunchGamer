  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless ramp that is 5 meters high. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the ramp?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "25 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "By conservation of energy, the gravitational potential energy of the block at the top of the ramp is converted entirely into kinetic energy at the bottom (assuming no friction). The initial potential energy is PE = mgh, where m = 2 kg, g = 10 m/s^2, and h = 5 m. So, PE = 2 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 5 m = 100 J. At the bottom, this energy becomes kinetic energy, KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed we want to find. Setting this equal to the initial energy, 100 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2. Solving for v, we get v = √(100 J / 1 kg) = √(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s."
