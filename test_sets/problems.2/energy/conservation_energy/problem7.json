  "question": "A 2 kg ball is dropped from a height of 5 meters. Assuming negligible air resistance, what is the speed of the ball just before it hits the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "25 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "By the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the ball is equal to its final kinetic energy (assuming negligible air resistance). \n\nInitial potential energy: PE = mgh = (2 kg)(10 m/s^2)(5 m) = 100 J\n\nFinal kinetic energy: KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed just before hitting the ground.\n\nEquating PE and KE: 100 J = (1/2)(2 kg)v^2\n\nSolving for v: v = √(100 J / 1 kg) = √(100 m^2/s^2) = 10 m/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of the ball just before hitting the ground is 10 m/s."
