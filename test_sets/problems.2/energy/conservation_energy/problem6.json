  "question": "A 2 kg block is released from rest at the top of a frictionless incline that is 5 m high. What is the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the incline?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "20 m/s",
    "D": "40 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "solution": "Using conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the block is converted entirely into kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline, assuming no energy loss due to friction. The initial potential energy is PE = mgh, where m is the mass (2 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height (5 m). Thus, PE = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 × 5 m = 98 J. At the bottom, the kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed we want to find. Setting PE equal to KE and solving for v: 98 J = (1/2) × 2 kg × v^2, which gives v^2 = 98 m^2/s^2, and v = √(98 m^2/s^2) ≈ 10 m/s."
