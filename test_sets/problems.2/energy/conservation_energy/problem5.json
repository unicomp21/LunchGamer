  "question": "A 2 kg rock is dropped from a height of 10 meters. Neglecting air resistance, what is the speed of the rock just before it hits the ground? (Take g = 10 m/s^2)",
  "choices": {
    "A": "5 m/s",
    "B": "10 m/s",
    "C": "14 m/s",
    "D": "20 m/s"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "Using the law of conservation of energy, the initial potential energy of the rock is converted to kinetic energy just before hitting the ground. The initial potential energy is PE = mgh = 2 kg * 10 m/s^2 * 10 m = 200 J. By conservation of energy, this equals the final kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv^2. Setting them equal: 200 J = (1/2) * 2 kg * v^2. Solving for v yields v = sqrt(200 J / (1 kg)) = sqrt(200 m^2/s^2) â‰ˆ 14 m/s."
