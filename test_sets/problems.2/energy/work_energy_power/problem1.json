  "question": "A 2 kg block is pushed a distance of 5 m across a frictionless surface by a constant force of 10 N. What is the change in the block's kinetic energy?",
  "choices": {
    "A": "20 J",
    "B": "40 J",
    "C": "50 J",
    "D": "100 J"
  },
  "answer": "C",
  "solution": "The change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done on the block. The work done is calculated using the formula W = F × d, where F is the force (10 N) and d is the displacement (5 m). Thus, W = 10 N × 5 m = 50 J. Since the surface is frictionless, all of the work done goes into increasing the block's kinetic energy, so the change in kinetic energy is 50 J."
